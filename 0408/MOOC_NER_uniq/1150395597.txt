An article last Sunday about massive open online courses, using information from theMOOCprovider Coursera, included several errors. The source of a study of peer grading in a <ORGANIZATION>Princeton</ORGANIZATION> sociologyMOOCwas <PERSON>Mitchell Duneier</PERSON>, the teacher, not Coursera. The student work was regraded by Professor <PERSON>Duneier</PERSON> and his teaching assistants, not by <ORGANIZATION>Princeton</ORGANIZATION> instructors. And it is not the case that the results have been released. The article also misspelled the surname of a co-founder of anotherMOOCprovider, Udacity.  He is <PERSON>Michael Sokolsky</PERSON>, not Sokolosky.
