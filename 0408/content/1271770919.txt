If you want a symbol of how technology is transforming corporate America, here's a good one: the chief information officer.That position has been recast from the guy who worried about the internal data network to the man or woman now central to virtually every major decision a company makes.Technology, of course, is driving this revolution. CIOs now devise sales systems that connect the business to customers, Randamp;D networks that link talent world-wide, and data tracking that guides complex supply chains. The job is so central to a company's success or failure that many CIOs--once denizens of the "back office"--now report directly to the top.With that bigger role in mind, CIOs from some of the world's top companies met last week for the first CIO Network, a conference held in San Diego by The Wall Street Journal. Topics mirrored the scope of the job: how to drive innovation, wrestle "big data" to the ground, sharpen management skills, fathom Washington policy and fight off cyberspying, among other subjects.Because the CIO is the top cop on the beat, it's not surprising that hacking was a dominant topic. Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co., told the group that she spent eight hours grappling with the subject in a recent meeting of CEOs.When polled, 45% of the CIOs at the gathering said their companies had already been hacked. In private, the chief information officer of one multinational said this was a woeful understatement. "It's not possible," he said. "Probably 100% have been hacked--and they know it."The CIOs had plenty to say on other matters. They favor iPhones over Android. They think the Obama administration has squelched innovation.And, no surprise, they believe by a wide margin that the modern-day CIO should report to the CEO.Credit: By John Bussey
