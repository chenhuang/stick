It is hard to go anywhere these days and not hear businesses talking about the advent of "big data" and the move of business to the cloud.We originally thought we might do a cover story on the twin trends, but soon realized the advances are permeating businesses far faster than we imagined. So we shifted gears and created this special report.Our regular subscribers will probably find the format familiar; we retained our traditional news sections and features into an attempt to show how no sector is going untouched by these innovations.We also wanted to explore how the concepts are being implemented, and show this is more than some preoccupation of technologists - not that there is anything wrong with the folks in IT!Washington, it turns out, is one of the focal points for thebig dataand cloud computing movement, and what happens here will surely inform the evolution of these concepts elsewhere.Please let us know what you think of the issue, and tell us what is happening at your place of work.If you are a newcomer to Capital Business, consider subscribing by calling 202-334-6100 or go to washingtonpost.com/capitalbusiness/subscribe.Each week we strive to provide the region's most comprehensive coverage of the local business scene, whether it involves a Fortune 500 giant or a business just starting up, and our weekly report is meant to complement our regular coverage in The Washington Post. - Dan Beyers, Editor
