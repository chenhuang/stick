The government has some new fellows.Last month, the White House launched the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program, a six-month program to bring nonprofit, private-sector and academic talent to bear on five government projects.The 18 fellows are charged with working on projects to help engineer greater government efficiency to benefit both the public and private sectors. More than 700 people applied for the 18 slots. Those selected were required to come to Washington to work alongside federal employees. The fellows will also use crowdsourced data and proposed solutions from members of the general public.Those introducing the program last month included U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, Chief Information Officer Steven Van Roekel, Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Jeffrey Zients, and Office of Personnel Management Director John Berry."I think all of us here are present at the creation of something great," Zients said.The five projects are the following:* MyGov will call on fellows to reimagine "the relationship between the federal government and its citizens through an online footprint" created for and by the public.* Open Data will give citizens an opportunity to leveragebig datato more efficiently find services, such as the best health-care provider or a college with the best value.* Blue Button, which is a service now available to military veterans, will allow patients to securely download their medical records as a text file.* RFP-EZ will result in the creation of a platform to make it easier for small businesses to navigate the federal government and for agencies to "quickly source low-cost, high-impact information technology solutions," according to a White House news release.* The "20 percent initiative" will seek to save the government 20 percent on its payments in support of foreign policy initiatives, development assistance, government operations and commercial activities. The 20 percent savings would come from ramping down, if not doing away with, the government's more expensive payment system of cash disbursements. Instead of cash, the initiative would provide the government greater access to electronic payment methods.The fellows represent a range of technology talent, including a user experience writer for TurboTax, two "serial entrepreneurs," six entrepreneurs overall, a Web site designer and an "interaction" designer. But of the 18 fellows, two are women and none are African American - two populations traditionally underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.The event ended with the 18 fellows taking the oath of office, administered by Berry.The program is separate from the older White House Fellows program, where individuals spend a year working for top-ranking government officials.To read more from the ideas@innovations blog, go to washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations.
