Novetta Solutions - formed by private-equity firm Arlington Capital Partners - has made its first acquisition.Novetta, which focuses on "big data," was itself created through acquisitions. Arlington Capital Partners combined Tysons Corner-based White Oak Technologies with Reston-based FGM to create Novetta in March, and named former CACI International executive Peter LaMontagnechief executive.Novetta said last week it has purchased Columbia-based White Cliffs Consulting, which has about 60 employees. The company specializes in digital discovery and software engineering for the intelligence and cyber community.LaMontagne said in an interview last week that even technical services such as software engineering are now becoming more commoditized, meaning agencies look for the lowest price. What White Cliffs offers, he said, is interdisciplinary expertise.White Cliffs Consulting will continue to be led by partners Diane Batchikand John Skordas and will retain its name.Novetta also named Richard Sawchak, formerly chief financial officer at Shafer Corp., chief financial officer.Protest upheld - againThe Government Accountability Office upheld a second protest filed by Reston-based NikSoft Systems against a Justice Department program.The department was seeking federal identity, credential and access management services for its chief information office and requested quotes from contractors already on a General Services Administration schedule. It ultimately awarded what's known as a blanket-purchase agreement, meant to speed individual orders, to LS3 Technologies of Odenton.The GAO sustained NikSoft's original protest, criticizing the Justice Department for failing to take into account the company's lower price. It also said the government erred in its evaluation of NikSoft's past performance. But when the department reevaluated, it still selected LS3 and NikSoft protested again.The GAO found last month that the department's records do not adequately explain the agency's decision and called for the Justice Department to once again reevaluate.Polycom reorganizesVideoconferencing company Polycom, which has its federal sales office in Herndon, has established a public sector organization by combining its federal, state and local organizations with its education, health care and grants units.Barry Morris, formerly vice president of the company's federal government division, has been named president of the Herndon-based unit."A lot of the same requirements, issues and concerns that the federal government has - they're shared with state and local government, education and medical," Morris said.censerm@washpost.comCredit: ;Marjorie Censer
