Invite venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to talk to senior leadership and identify ways your business is going to be disrupted. Drive innovation; be the keeper of the forward view.3. Influence With ImpactCIOs must be able to effectively communicate. And they must understand the context of their organization.4.
