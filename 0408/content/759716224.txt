There will be a drumbeat of housing data this week leading up to the big announcement of third-quarter gross domestic product Friday.Data are scheduled to be released on existing home sales for September. Economists forecast that sales rose 4.1 percent, a slower rate of improvement than the 7.6 percent gain in August but nonetheless suggesting a steady improvement in home sales activity from the extraordinary low levels following the end of the home buyers' tax credit in the spring.Two home price indexes, the Standard andamp; Poor's Case-Shiller index and the Federal Housing Finance Agency index, are expected to show a 0.2 percent decline in prices. That would be consistent with other evidence that, while housing prices aren't falling off a cliff, they are gliding downward gradually.Analysts expect data on new home sales to show a 4.2 percent increase in transactions in September, after being flat in August.Other data points are scheduled to come out as well:Durable goods orders are forecasted to have risen a healthy 2 percent in September, following a dip in August.Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key measure of equipment spending by businesses, are expected to rise 0.5 percent, also reflecting steady improvement.Thebig datapoint of the week will be the Commerce Department's release of third-quarter GDP data. Analysts expect a 2 percent annual pace of growth in the July through September period, which would be a slight acceleration from the 1.7 percent growth rate in the second quarter.But even if the forecast proves accurate, 2 percent is not a growth rate to write home about; the U.S. economy grows a bit faster than that in the long run just because of population growth and rising productivity. And it certainly isn't fast enough to bring unemployment down anytime soon.- Neil Irwin
