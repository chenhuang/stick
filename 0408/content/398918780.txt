Dow Jones NewswiresThe engine knocks but the motor's still running in the high-yield bond market after auto-parts maker Delphi Corp. filed for bankruptcy.That wasn't the only roadblock thrown up in the market for speculative-grade bonds this week: Fellow auto supplier Dana Corp. is restating earnings for the past six quarters due to accounting errors in its commercial-vehicle supply business. And credit-rating agency Standard andamp; Poor's cut its rating on General Motors Corp. a notch to double-B-minus from double-B, citing the Chapter 11 filing by Delphi, a former unit of GM."There's a pall over the whole auto sector," said Margaret Patel, portfolio manager at Pioneer High Yield Fund, which has $6 billion in assets. Because of GM and Ford Motor Co.'s large amount of outstanding debt and a near 10% weighting in the widely followed Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index, weakness in auto bonds widens risk premiums on non-auto bonds too."It's a pretty rough day out there," said Justin Monteith, market analyst at Montpelier, Vt., high-yield research firm KDP Investment Advisors.Amid heavy trading yesterday -- the first full day of trading in the fixed-income markets after the Columbus Day holiday -- the overall market declined by up to half a point. Auto bonds and auto-parts bonds were the hardest hit.Delphi bonds, which dropped four to five points Monday, took a second-day tumble. Delphi's 6.55% bonds due 2006 fell 8 3/4 points, or cents on the dollar, to 56, according to MarketAxess, an electronic trading service for corporate bonds.Dana's 6.50% bonds due 2009 tumbled 10 1/2 to 79 3/4 cents on the dollar, the biggest losers in the sector, according to MarketAxess. And GM's 8.375% bonds due 2033 fell 4 1/2 to 73."It reminds us that the motor-vehicles sector counts for a disproportionate amount of downgrades," said Moody's Investors Service chief economist John Lonski. "Defaults are dominated by the auto and commercial-airline sectors . . . but they have yet to spread."The low default rate is one bright spot in the prevailing gloom, supporting the market for risky debt even as the auto sector has skidded."It's amazing how well the high-yield bond market has held up" in the face of all the auto-related problems, said Mr. Lonski.Risk premiums remain on average at historically tight levels. The average risk premium on the Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index through Friday was 3.59 percentage points over Treasurys, compared with 3.54 percentage points at the end of September.The global speculative-grade default rate inched up to 2% in the third quarter from 1.8%, Moody's reported last week. But total defaulted bonds leapt to $14 billion from $1.4 billion, a tenfold increase, driven partly by airlines, Moody's said. However, Moody's also saw "no obvious signs of a sharp deterioration in credit quality coming the next year."Next week, GM on Monday will report its third-quarter results, to be followed by Ford on Thursday. "[GM is] the nextbig datapoint on auto makers," said Kevin Akioka, portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Payden andamp; Rygel Investment Management, with $3 billion in high-yield assets."Some of the volatility [leading up to the earnings reports] might keep a couple people on the sidelines a little longer," he said.TreasurysTreasury prices were lower Tuesday, weighed down by concerns over higher inflation, with the main event of the session the release of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee minutes from its Sept. 20 meeting.After the customary three-week lag during which Fed officials have been vocal about the inflation threat posed by higher energy prices, the minutes revealed policy makers felt more rate increases would be necessary."Even after today's action -- when the overnight borrowing rate was raised to 3.75% from 3.50% -- the federal-funds rate would likely be below the level that would be necessary to contain inflationary pressures, and further rate increases probably would be required," according to the minutes.The comments generally met the expectations of bond investors. "The market reaction was fairly muted, after the recent speeches by Fed officials highlighting higher inflation risk, we were prepared for hawkish minutes," said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 9/32 point, or 28.125 cents per $1,000 face value, at 98 28/32. Its yield rose to 4.393%, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 16/32 point, at 111 17/32, to yield 4.599%.AUCTION RESULTSHere are the results of the Treasury auction of 13-week and 26-week bills.All bids are awarded at a single price at the market-clearing yield.
