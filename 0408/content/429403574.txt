Special to The New York TimesShares of the Oracle Corporation fell more than 12 percent today as analysts downgraded their ratings for the stock.Oracle, the leading producer of software that manages large computer data bases, has outperformed analysts' expectations in each of the previous six quarters, but has always been a volatile stock.Oracle reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter after the market closed on Tuesday, and while its net income was slightly above the Wall Street estimates, its revenue growth had slowed from the previous quarters, leading some analysts to lower their expectations. Some other analysts said the market selloff was an overreaction.Shares of Oracle fell $4.375, to $31.25, in Nasdaq trading. Shares of otherbig database producers also fell: Sybase Inc. was down $1.125, to $39.75, and the Informix Corporation fell 12.5 cents, to $20.125. Improved MarginsOracle's results followed by a day an announcement by Banyan Systems Inc., a producer of networking software, that its fourth-quarter results would be below analysts' estimates."Revenues came at the low end of the range, and they made their earnings numbers by an incredible improvement in operating margins," said David Readerman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.The fact that Oracle shares had been up 146 percent this year, and $3 this week, might have prompted profit taking, he said.For the fiscal second quarter of 1994, ended on Nov. 30, Oracle reported earnings of $62.1 million, or 21 cents a share, an increase of 86 percent from $33.5 million, or 11 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year. Revenues increased 28 percent, to $452.2 million, from $353.2 million in the comparable period a year ago. Unusual FactorsJeff Henley, the executive vice president and chief financial officer of Oracle, said in a telephone interview that the results had met the expectations of the company's management, but that two unusual factors had lowered the apparent revenue growth: the effect of foreign currency exchange, and fewer sales by the company's systems-integration unit."We're not concerned; nothing has changed," Mr. Henley said. "We have been in a rapid turnaround mode for the last two years, and in a number of quarters we have exceeded analysts' expectations. When we do that, they raise their numbers even higher.""Oracle Corp.
