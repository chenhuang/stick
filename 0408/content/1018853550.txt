Chevron Uses 'Big Data'To Cut Exploration CostsChevron Corp. is hoping to reduce the cost of sending drillships used to extract oil from extremely deep waters by using sophisticated analytic tools to identify likely reservoirs of oil.To find oil in places like the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron sends ships to survey areas suspected to contain oil or gas deposits.The ships generate waves creating seismic data that is then converted into a picture that Chevron engineers can use to determine where oil is located.It is important that this picture is as clear as possible because drilling in deep water is expensive. Drillships cost roughly $1 million per day to operate, according to a September 2011 presentation by Peter Breunig, general manager of IT technology and architecture at Chevron.The company is using open-source software called Hadoop to analyze "ridiculous amounts of data," according to Steve Walker, who works in data research, analytics and data warehousing at Chevron and spoke at a conference Tuesday.The information collected is a correlation of five dimensions of data -- the x and y coordinates of the amplitude and arrival times of seismic waves sent to the ocean floor, as well as the time the data was collected -- one in 25 analytic steps Chevron takes to create a picture for engineers to use to locate oil reservoirs.Mr. Walker said the company is investigating other uses for Hadoop, and predicts that within a few years, the entire energy industry will have embraced data science.Mr. Walker spoke at The Economist's Ideas Economy: Information conference in San Francisco, sponsored by Cloudera Inc., which helps companies implement Hadoop.Doug Cutting, chief architect of Cloudera and co-creator of Hadoop, who also spoke at a the lunch, said "with oil companies, the more seismic data they have, the better they can find pockets of oil and natural gas underground."One benefit of using Hadoop is that it can reduce the cost of seismic data processing by a factor of 10, according to a paper published by Cloudera in January.-- Rachael KingNRG's Internal SocialNetwork Actually WorksCompanies often experiment with using social networking tools to connect their employees -- who often grumble at the thought of such an initiative. But at NRG Energy Inc., employees are actually warming up to a new tool that lets them share information and collaborate on projects.Energy Plus, a subsidiary of NRG, deployed a social network earlier this year that employees use to create ad hoc chat rooms which end up becoming stores of FAQs for later use on a specific topic, said Hugh Scott, the company's CIO.Mr. Scott's team has also used the tool to share software code and to get feedback from employees in the organization that need the tool the developers are creating.The social network -- called HipChat, from software vendor Atlassian -- was recommended to Mr. Scott by a member of his technology team after an earlier attempt at social networking using software from another company failed to catch on.Mr. Scott isn't sure why the previous experiment failed -- "literally nobody used it," he says -- but in retrospect, he thinks having launched HipChat without fanfare was important.Mr. Scott doesn't have any formal metrics to measure the new tool's success, but says he can tell it is working for two reasons. One, people are using HipChat as a verb, as in, "I'll HipChat you."But also because the team had created a chat room called the "Nourishment" room they use to alert each other whenever there is free food in the kitchen.-- Michael Hickins---CIO Journal is a Wall Street Journal news service for business technology executives.
