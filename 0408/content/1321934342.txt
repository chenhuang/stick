GovernmentU.S. agencies slowto adoptbig dataFederal managers see opportunity inbig databut aren't confident that their agencies are taking advantage of this information, according to a new study by Booz Allen Hamilton and the Government Business Council, the research division of Government Executive magazine.The report, which was underwritten by McLean-based contractor Booz Allen, was based on a survey completed by 313 federal managers from 27 agencies this year as well as interviews. It found that about two-thirds of those surveyed believebig data- chunks of information too large to be easily managed by typical computer programs - could fundamentally transform federal operations.Yet, a much smaller share - about 37 percent - said their agency is taking the right steps to leveragebig datato improve agency operations. Eighteen percent of managers reported they have full professional proficiency in understanding large data sets.Many of those questioned cited inadequate resources, technological barriers and misaligned budget priorities as impediments to federal progress.- Marjorie CenserLOCAL FIRMSBode Technology names new CEOBode Technology Group of Lorton announced last week that Michael Cariola is the company's chief executive and president, taking over for Barry Watson.Cariola was chief operating officer of Bode, which works with law enforcement and other government agencies to provide forensic DNA-collection products as well as analysis and research services.
