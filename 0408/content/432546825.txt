The EMC Corporation agreed yesterday to acquire Documentum, a management software company, in a $1.7 billion stock swap, in a bid to secure a top spot in the market for helping companies keep track of disparate information ranging from Web pages to X-rays. Documentum's shares surged $3.95, or 16 percent, to $28.37. EMC's shares fell $1.17, or more than 8 percent, to $13.28. But EMC said Documentum, which is based in Pleasanton, Calif., was perfect for EMC's strategy of looking for growth on its software side -- rather than from thebig data-storage hardware devices it also sells. EMC purchased Legato Systems in July in a deal valued at $1.2 billion -- its first major purchase in years after a period of retrenchment -- and said at the time another similarly sized deal was on the horizon. Under the agreement, Documentum stockholders would receive 2.175 shares of EMC common stock for each share of Documentum common stock -- valuing each Documentum share at $28.88 based on yesterday's prices.Credit: Bloomberg News
