HOPKINTON, Mass. -- EMC Corp. Chairman Michael C. Ruettgers exercised stock options last year in which he realized $67.1 million in gains, much greater than those of the prior year.In addition, Mr. Ruettgers received salary, bonus and other compensation of $2.9 million, an increase of about 45% over 1999.EMC said in its annual proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Mr. Ruettgers, who was also chief executive of thebig data-storage concern last year, exercised 900,000 options in 2000. That represented 29% of options exercisable during the year. His remaining 2.23 million exercisable options at the end of last year were valued at $140.6 million.In 1999, Mr. Reutters cashed in about 20% of his options, valued at $13.4 million. Mr, Ruettgers stepped down as EMC's chief executive last month.A spokesman for EMC said the sale of the stock options was a "fairly normal and routine exercising for Mr. Ruettgers" that was done for "tax-planning and diversification purposes."The filing also disclosed that EMC is seeking shareholder approval to double its shares outstanding to six billion. Although the company said it had no immediate plans for issuance, a big increase in authorization often signals a company wants the flexibility to use its stock as takeover currency.
