A penny saved is a penny earned, and amid a tepid recovery, companies like financial-software and services firm Intuit (INTU) are helping to fatten the wallets of consumers and small businesses alike.Intuit, best known for its Quicken and TurboTax, products that make managing household finances and tax preparation almost easy, has quietly become a force for small-business owners.The firm derived 39% of its $4.15 billion fiscal-2012 revenue from its small-business segment, which includes its QuickBooks financial-management tools.And its chief financial officer, Neil Williams, says the small-business segment has the most potential for growth.Intuit has a dominant share in many of its businesses, including online tax preparation and financial management, and it just rolled out QuickBooks globally. It also recently acquired Demandforce, which provides online marketing and communication tools for local businesses. It's also sprucing up its core tax offering, which accounts for 45% of revenue, adding live advisers to its online filing service and enabling tax filing from mobile devices.Investors have been unimpressed, however. Intuit stock has "completely underperformed" the market over the past 12 months, says James Lane, an analyst and consultant to Northstar Investment Management in Chicago. He says the shares are undervalued and could jump nearly 30% in the next 18 to 24 months, from the high $50s now to the mid-$70s.Investors appear to underestimate how much Intuit's businesses are being turbocharged by the growing popularity of mobile devices. The company has more than 50 mobile applications and has seen customers using cloud-based services grow to 45 million from seven million in 2008.Intuit is "an overnight sensation 25 years in the making," says Peter Goldmacher, an analyst at Cowen who rates Intuit "outperform."Calling this "the era ofbig datafor the little guy," Intuit Chief Executive Brad Smith recently noted that Intuit's products "put more money" in customers' pockets. Patient investors who bet on its shares should find Intuit putting more money in theirs as well.Write to Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal atRobin Goldwyn Blumenthal is a senior editor for Barron's.
