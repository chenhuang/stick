Harry Shearer is the host of the weekly radio broadcast ''Le Show.''IT'S at least arguable that America's only true indigenous art form is industrial music, the anthems and mini-musical productions that corporations commission to impress clients and bludgeon sales forces into action. After all, people in other countries have mastered jazz, rap and gospel. Nobody on another continent has yet achieved the delicate balance of peppiness, boosterism and dementia that industrial music demands.Recently, the Web site zdnet.co.uk/specials/2002/it-anthems/ has become popular for keeping a Top 20 chart of the I.M. commissioned by I.T. (information technology) firms. Some of the more robust lyrics from that site are offered here, along with a couple of vintage compositions from my personal collection (which can be heard on the Web at nytimes.com/weekinreview/).
