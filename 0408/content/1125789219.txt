As the presidential race comes to a close, the technology world has learned that Washington wants others to do as it says, not as it does. For all the threatened regulation of the Internet in the name of protecting privacy, the presidential campaigns have gone further than commercial advertisers ever have in using online and offline data to target people.Spending on online political ads, which let politicians target individual voters, is many times greater than in 2008. The Obama administration and its Federal Trade Commission have long threatened "do not track" and other regulations that would make hypertargeting unlawful. How about if whoever wins on Tuesday, having benefited from digital technology in winning votes, rewards the Internet by leaving it alone?Campaigns now target voters with a three-step process. Like other online advertisers, they drop a "cookie" on users' computers after they visit a particular website--perhaps Huffington Post on the left or Drudge Report on the right. The cookie sends information back to the campaign about the user's online activity, information that is combined with offline data from companies with massive consumer databases of the kind used by retailers, adding details such as the neighborhood where the voter lives, the car he drives, and the charities he supports, as well as income, sex and race. Political campaigns then add another level of data: information from publicly available voting records, including party registration and frequency of voting.In the old days, everyone--Democrats, Republicans, enthusiasts, nonvoters and undecideds--saw the same television ads. Now the campaigns use "big data" to craft highly customized and even personalized messages as people go from website to website. The campaigns test just the right ads for each voter.In addition, predictive analysts and other number crunchers mine the interests and opinions that people divulge on social-media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn. The head of Twitter's political-ad sales team, Paul Greenberg, recently told the Hill newspaper how campaigns use his site: "Geo-targeting can target by interest, location, mobile device access. . . . It's pretty remarkable how minutely we can target."All these data are then combined using complex algorithms covering many million "decision nodes" to model attributes for each person. A wealthy urban liberal sees different ads online than a working-class centrist. People who care more about jobs see different ads than people who focus on social issues.Evidon, which tracks software on websites, recently analyzed the campaign sites. It discovered that for all the Democratic complaints about violations of online privacy by companies, BarackObama.com includes 87 different tracking cookies dropped on visitors--more even than on the Best Buy website. The software includes categories such as "ad scripts," "behavioral trackers" and "analytics." MittRomney.com had 48 such tracking services on its site. The investigative journalism group ProPublica reports that both parties have political information on 150 million Internet users in the U.S., or about 80% of registered voters.The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group, says more-targeted political ads are better, just as more-targeted ads are better for other products and services. "Political campaigns now for the first time can actually reach out to prospective voters with messaging that addresses each person's specific interests and causes," the group said, estimating that online political advertising will reach $160 million this year, compared with $20 million in 2008.A recent University of Pennsylvania study found that people are less comfortable being targeted by political ads online than being targeted for goods and services. Perhaps this is because voting is supposed to be confidential--or maybe it's because no one really likes political ads. People may also suspect that hypertargeting takes political pandering to a higher level.In any case, it's all the more amusing that pro-regulation politicians so aggressively use tools they say they want made unlawful.There is a real threat to the vibrancy of the Internet from overregulation. The Obama administration has extracted 20-year consent decrees from Silicon Valley's most innovative companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, based on how they use personal information to drive targeted advertising. Such micromanagement of a growth industry's key revenue driver is unprecedented.Online advertising revenue, based on delivering efficient marketing, is what enables users to get so many free services online. That arrangement is at risk if regulators follow through on threats to change how data can be used online.Politicians have tried to find ways to deliver targeted messages since the political pamphleteering of the Founders. Whoever wins the White House on Tuesday should give credit to how his campaign made smart use of targeted advertising online--and then let the Internet continue to evolve without getting in the way.Credit: By                     L.
