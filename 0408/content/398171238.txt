REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Oracle Systems Corp. reported its first quarterly loss, with results significantly lower than it had forecast nearly three weeks ago.Thebig data-base software company said it had a net loss of $36 million, or 27 cents a share, for the first quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with net income of $11.7 million, or nine cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 16% to $203.7 million, from $175.5 million.On Sept. 7, Oracle had warned that it would report a loss, mainly because revenue didn't meet a 50% growth target. In the announcement, however, the company estimated revenue growth in the first quarter at 30%, much higher than the 16% reported yesterday. Moreover, Oracle had previously warned of a loss of 20 cents a share, considerably narrower than the actual 27 cents a share.Michael Fields, the new president of Oracle's USA division, said the change in results occurred because of "a major deterioration in the projected numbers from the USA finance" department. He said the department's projections included sales contracts that couldn't be recognized in the quarter, and excluded compensation for sales representatives who were no longer with the company.The earnings report was yet another of a series of recent surprises for the company. In March, its stock sank 31% after reporting flat third-quarter earnings. It also reported some accounting problems and a week ago fired 400 workers to cut costs."While we are disappointed with our first quarter results, we expect to return to profitability in our second quarter," said Lawrence Ellison, Oracle's president and co-founder.Oracle's earnings were reported after the close of trading. Its stock finished at $7.375 a share in over-the-counter trading yesterday, up 12.5 cents. Since March, Oracle's shares have dropped about 74%.
