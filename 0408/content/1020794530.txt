It seems that the meteoric rise of social networking andbig datahas touched almost every sector, and commercial real estate is a clear beneficiary. Over the past eight years, network server processing speed and storage capacity has increased about seven fold, and companies are finding ways to make better use of that technology through innovations such as cloud computing.However, improvements in hardware have not kept pace with the exponential increase in information and data: Since 2004, the number of Facebook users has increased 900 fold, LinkedIn users have increased 100 fold, Google searches are up by a factor of 24, and every day, nearly 10 years of content is uploaded to YouTube. The gap between the advances in hardware capabilities and the increase in data and information continues to drive demand for more data center space.While data center demand has steadily increased nationwide, the Washington area has been grabbing a bigger piece of the pie over the years, with Northern Virginia winning the pie-eating contest. The Dulles tech corridor found its way onto the data center map in the 1990s, thanks to the presence of America Online and other telecom giants, and it remains a relevant and desirable location for tech companies today.Occupied data center space in the region's tech hub has nearly tripled over the past eight years, far outpacing the 28 percent increase for the United States. The Dulles tech corridor has attracted institutional capital as well. Real estate investment trusts that specialize in owning and operating data centers have the highest concentration of holdings in Northern Virginia, nearly 3.8 million square feet, eclipsing the more than the 3 million square feet of assets they own in Silicon Valley.These REITs have placed their bets on the Washington region, and Northern Virginia in particular, continuing to be an important center of tech. Over 1 million square feet for new data centers in locations such as Ashburn and Reston is currently in the development pipeline, bringing the total to nearly 5 million square feet.Our increasingly digitized world should continue to benefit the region's commercial real estate and larger economy over the coming years, with Northern Virginia a veritable bright spot, and should help offset the drag that future federal government austerity measures are likely to create.Erica Champion is a senior real estate economist with CoStar Group in Washington.
