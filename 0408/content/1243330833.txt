Internet entrepreneurs have had the upper hand over venture capitalists in recent years but that balance of power is now showing some signs of shifting, a trend that could accelerate in 2013.Spurring the change is a dramatically lower appetite for risk from venture capitalists. Many investors rushed to get into Web startup deals in 2010, 2011 and in the early part of this year, often acceding to entrepreneurs' demands for rising valuations in order to snag a stake in their companies.But following the disappointing stock market performances of recently public Web companies Facebook Inc., Zynga Inc. and Groupon Inc., venture capitalists are reining in their spending in areas like the consumer Internet.That's having a knock-on effect on entrepreneurs, who are having to scramble for a smaller pool of dollars and perhaps settle for a lower-than-expected valuation in the process."There's been a definite slowdown in the pace of activity" of investment, said Todd Chaffee, a venture capitalist at Institutional Venture Partners. He said that in the first half of 2012, startups would visit venture firms seeking a high valuation and "four or five firms would hit the bid. Now no firms hit the bid."Consider the recent financing of e-commerce site Zulily Inc., which holds "flash sales" of children's clothing and other accouterments.The Seattle-based company raised $85 million last month from Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in a deal that valued the startup at $1 billion, up from a valuation of more than $700 million last year.The fundraising was successful -- but venture capitalist Marc Andreessen considers the timing of the deal lucky for his firm. Zulily, which is growing fast, could likely have raised "two to three to four times the valuation a year ago," said Mr. Andreessen. Instead, with other investors generally pulling back, "we felt like we benefited," he said."We do think Andreessen Horowitz got a great deal," said Zulily Chief Executive Darrell Cavens, through a spokeswoman. "For us, it's not just about raising money, it's raising money with the right partners. We selected Andreessen Horowitz because they're invested in us for the long run."Investment into U.S. venture-backed companies totaled $6.92 billion across 820 deals in the third quarter, the latest data available, down from $10.1 billion and 906 financing deals in the year-earlier period, according to research firm VentureSource, which like The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp.While 61% of venture financings in the third quarter achieved "up" rounds, where valuations rose from a previous fundraising, that percentage was lower than the 74% of fundraisings that snagged "up" rounds in the second quarter, according to a survey of Silicon Valley venture financings by law firm Fenwick andamp; West LLC.The median price increase of financings in the third quarter was 23%, adds Fenwick, down from a 30% increase in the prior quarter.The venture pullback isn't limited to the Web startups that command billion-dollar valuations.At the earliest-stage levels, there are also signs of investor caution. Last month, popular startup incubator Y Combinator said it would revamp a funding program so that investors would put $80,000 into each of its startups, down from $150,000 previously."We're decreasing the amount invested because experience showed $150k was too much," Y Combinator announced in a blog post. "$150k was more than the successful startups needed, and it sometimes caused messy disputes in the unsuccessful ones."Of course technology entrepreneurs still hold many of the cards, especially if their company is growing quickly in revenue and customers.Some of the venture dollars that once went to consumer Web deals have simply rotated into other fast-growing tech sectors, including companies inBig Data, next-generation storage and cloud computing services.This enterprise technology has "continued to build in enthusiasm and valuations," said Scott Sandell, a venture capitalist at New Enterprise Associates, who said his firm has dialed back investments in consumer Web companies but has been ratcheting up in business-tech investments.Still, the shifting risk calculations by venture capitalists are having an impact on venture investment numbers.Whether entrepreneurs have yet caught up to the shifting investor sentiment is unclear. In a recent survey of venture capitalists and CEOs of venture-backed companies, the National Venture Capital Association and VentureSource found that CEOs remain far more bullish than investors.Only 38% of venture capitalists surveyed expect startup valuations in their portfolios to rise next year, compared with 78% of CEOs who predict a jump in their company valuation.Paul Bragiel, who runs startup accelerator i/o Ventures in San Francisco, said entrepreneurs still have more information and clout than they did five or 10 years ago.But he acknowledged many can't just snap their fingers and expect to be funded now, with entrepreneurial power taking "a small little dip."Edouard Tabet, the founder of social travel startup ZeTrip in Menlo Park, Calif., closed $515,000 in seed money last month but said the process "was harder than what I expected."The entrepreneur, who began fundraising in August, said many investors didn't initially respond to his requests to meet while others told him they were "pausing" their investments.Nine out of 10 investors offered rejections, he said, citing how crowded the online travel industry has become."You see a lot of people raising all this money and say why not me?" Mr. Tabet said. Raising money now only "seems easy from the outside," he said.Subscribe to WSJ:Credit: By Pui-Wing Tam
