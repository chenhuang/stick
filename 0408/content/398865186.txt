A federal judge dismissed one of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s claims against Microsoft Corp. in its longstanding lawsuit over Java, but the setback for Sun may be overshadowed by Java's progress and Microsoft's antitrust trial.The Sun-Microsoft case, which dates back to 1997, centers on Sun's Java, a computer language designed to build programs that can run on any computer without major changes. Sun's original suit charged that Microsoft violated the terms of a licensing agreement and infringed Sun's copyrights when it modified its version of Java to include elements that would only work with Windows.Late Monday night, Judge Ronald Whyte of the U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif., dismissed the claim that Microsoft had violated Sun's copyrights with its version of Java. The immediate impact of the decision is relatively minor, though, as the case will continue and Microsoft remains bound by a preliminary injunction that prohibits it from distributing versions of Java that are incompatible with Sun's prescriptions.Judge Whyte had originally granted Sun a preliminary injunction based on the copyright-infringement claim, noting that Sun was likely to prevail on the issue. But an appellate court ordered the judge to reconsider that decision, on the grounds that he hadn't sufficiently explained why Microsoft's behavior amounted to copyright infringement.Judge Whyte partially reinstated the injunction in January, but based it on a second Sun claim that Microsoft had breached its contract with Sun when it distributed its incompatible version of Java. That charge is generally not considered as serious as the copyright-infringement claim that was dismissed Monday, since it doesn't touch on core intellectual-property issues.Still, the overall importance of the Sun-Microsoft suit seems to be fading. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled last month that Microsoft, as part of a pattern of activities to illegally maintain its operating-system monopoly, engaged in an effort to "split" the Java standard. And Sun-standard Java continues to make inroads for use on Internet servers and inbig datacenters.Credit: Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
