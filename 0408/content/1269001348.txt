But Kollsman's price of $53.6 million, compared to L-3's $35.7 million, gave L-3 the edge.The GAO found that the Navy failed to adequately support its past performance evaluation of L-3 and recommended the agency reassess. It also called for Kollsman to be reimbursed the costs of pursuing its protest.Lockheed reorganizesIn one of her first orders of business as chief executive, Marillyn A.
