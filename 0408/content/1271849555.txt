[The technology executives at last week's CIO Network conference divided into five task forces to debate their management and and policy agendas in the following areas. Here are their top recommendations.]GETTING AHEAD OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY1. CREATING A CULTURECIOs should create a cultural appetite that accepts change, risks and failure, and understands that innovation can take time. Invite venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to talk to senior leadership and identify ways your business is going to be disrupted.2. MAKING THE CALLAccept that managing innovation requires living in a gray area between art and science. Don't follow your gut or the rules. Follow the odds.3. PARTITION DISRUPTIONName the disruption and then partition it as a separate business with separate financials, people and metrics.4. KEEP HEAD OUT OF SANDIdentify and accept inevitabilities and work them into your strategy. Create an unassailable argument around the inevitable to gain acceptance in the organization.CO-CHAIRS:Celso Guiotoko, Corporate Vice President and CIO, Nissan Motor Co.Scott Singer, Head of Global Business Services, Information Systems and Technology, Managing Director -- Singapore, Rio Tinto PLCEash Sundaram, Executive Vice President and CIO, JetBlue Airways Corp.SUBJECT EXPERT:Michael E.
