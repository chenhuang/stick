For all the buzz overbig data, there remains plenty of confusion over what it is and how industry can make use of it.Simply put, it is neither a market nor a technology.Big datacan be defined as any large data set, structured or unstructured. Typically, such expansive collections cannot properly be analyzed using traditional computing methods to glean the kinds of insights that enable good business decisions.A TechAmerica Foundation report onbig dataissued in October comparedbig datato the term "e-business," which gained popularity in the 1990s tech boom.The term faded away, but the idea remains the foundation of most commerce.Companies that focus on riding thebig datawave miss the point by treatingbig datalike it is a new technology or a new market. It is a new way of thinking that will guide the way federal agencies plan their technology buys.Because traditional computing methods are inadequate, agencies that want to take full advantage ofbig datawould need to invest to handle massive and constantly growing data sets. This could include dedicated hardware, network equipment to increase bandwidth, advanced analytics software and hiring specialists to analyze and report on the data.Making a separate mission of tacklingbig datais likely to be cost-prohibitive for most federal agencies. The expense of storing all of the data and expanding the bandwidth of networks to accommodate moving it may simply be out of reach.Instead, agencies will likely seek to make gradual upgrades, much as they have done with cloud computing. Agencies are moving into the cloud piecemeal, often hidden from public view as work is either written into existing contracts or competed within the context of broad contract vehicles.Winning this kind of work requires a strategic plan, not products. The most forward-thinking contractors seebig datanot as a new chance to sell something, but as a new way of viewing how federal agencies plan. They're focused on educating their clients on how to write and implement that plan.Lauren Jones is a senior principal research analyst and Alex Rossino is a principal research analyst at Herndon-based Deltek, which conducts research on the government contracting market and can be found at www.deltek.com.Credit: Lauren Jones;Alex Rossino
