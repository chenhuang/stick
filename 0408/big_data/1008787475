<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Steve Ballmer keeps a paperless office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft chief executive told a crowd of high-tech executives at a Northern Virginia Technology Council gathering in Tysons Corner last week that his workspace is now anchored by handheld computers and a large, digital monitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a fitting anecdote for a company that's trying to establish its prowess in mobile technology, cloud computing and &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; analytics as those technology trends continue to captivate consumers and companies alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer told the crowd that the shift to cloud computing has just begun and that a combination of shared and private clouds will be the norm, particularly among government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You'll get people who do one or the other but I think there's really a role and a purpose [for both] and I underscore that particularly here in Northern Virginia where we're going to have a lot more private cloud interest for a lot longer than we're going to see in some commercial sectors." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crowd was also given a demo of Microsoft's forthcoming Windows 8 operating system for personal computers, tablets and mobile phones. The company is playing catch-up with Apple and Android devices in those latter two categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've got a lot of work to do to break through what is now a very competitive market," Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under new management &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reston-based ScienceLogic has secured $15 million from investors and appointed a new chief executive as the firm looks to capitalize on the rise in cloud computing among companies and government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Becker will become head of the company. He most recently was chief executive of Herndon-based security software firm Approva. ScienceLogic's co-founder and current chief executive, David Link, will remain chairman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're at an inflection point," Link said. "Unequivocally I can tell you this is the time for us to double down and have the right management alignment to go after this opportunity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New Enterprise Associates and Intel Capital provided the $15 million investment, which marks the firm's second financing round since its formation in 2003. ScienceLogic has raised $30 million to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The money will allow the 100-employee company to expand its sales force, increase marketing and improve its existing information technology and cloud computing management technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; overlys@washpost.com &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>Overly, Steven</author><abstract>The Microsoft chief executive told a crowd of high-tech executives at a Northern Virginia Technology Council gathering in Tysons Corner last week that his workspace is now anchored by handheld computers and a large, digital monitor.</abstract><title>Ballmer: Focus is on mobile, cloud</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1008787475?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Apr 23, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1008787475</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
