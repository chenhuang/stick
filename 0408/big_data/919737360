<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Mark P. Mills and Julio M. Ottino might be right that &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;, smart manufacturing and wireless connectivity will be just as transformative in the 21st century as electrification, telephony, the automobile, stainless steel and radio amplification were in the 20th century ("The Coming Tech-led Boom," op-ed, Jan. 30). But any prognostications should include what will not change, and that is human nature and its influence over politics and government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What if a German citizen in 1912 foresaw the next 50 years in the same way Messrs. Mills and Ottino suggest we do in 2012? That German would have been right about technology, but blind to the changes that would produce catastrophic hardships on the Germans and others for the next 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We should remain hopeful that new technologies will make our world better, but we should not be blind to the more important issue: preventing the concentration of power in the hands of an unaccountable few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nathan R. Norris &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pike Road, Ala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't hold your breath waiting for politicians to deliver what it takes for the U.S. to exploit the promise of new technologies. That will be left to the private sector to do what it does best -- capitalize on its fecundity of innovation and develop global outreach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frank G.
