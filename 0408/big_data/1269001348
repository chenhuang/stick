<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Fairfax-based SRA International is sparing the 222 Arlington employees it thought it would have to cut after losing a major contract with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company filed a protest in the contract, which was awarded to Falls Church-based Computer Sciences Corp., and the General Services Administration has terminated the award, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SRA said in a statement that it has not made any layoffs related to the FDIC. "To support our focus on the customer's mission and contract requirements, we are adding talent," the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GSA confirmed in a statement that it has decided to "take corrective action," but would not provide details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft gets sprawling licensing agreement &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft earlier this month announced it -- through reseller Insight Public Sector -- has entered into a major licensing agreement with the Army, Air Force and Defense Information Systems Agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three-year, $617 million agreement gives the three agencies a single vehicle through which they can purchase Microsoft technologies, and military officials have said they expect it to result in millions of dollars in savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Solms, general manager of Microsoft's Defense Department business, said the agreement will give Microsoft a toehold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a bit of a referendum for the Microsoft solution," he said. "We're doing everything from the Home Use Program, allowing families to download and use software at home ... to tablets and slate devices all the way up through collaboration, information mobility ... data center consolidation and the ability to address &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GAO sustains Kollsman protest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Government Accountability Office has backed losing bidder McLean-based Kollsman in a protest against Londonderry, N.H.-based L-3 Communications, which won a Navy contract for handheld laser markers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the GAO -- which made its decision in October and released the decision earlier this month -- Kollsman's proposal received a higher technical rating than that of L-3. But Kollsman's price of $53.6 million, compared to L-3's $35.7 million, gave L-3 the edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GAO found that the Navy failed to adequately support its past performance evaluation of L-3 and recommended the agency reassess. It also called for Kollsman to be reimbursed the costs of pursuing its protest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lockheed reorganizes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one of her first orders of business as chief executive, Marillyn A. Hewson has consolidated Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin's corporate structure and plans to reduce its staff by about 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a memo sent to employees last week, Hewson said she is moving Lockheed's enterprise business services and corporate internal audit units into its finance and business operations organization. The company's operations and program management group is to be integrated into its corporate engineering and technology unit to focus the group on "innovation and program performance," she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Lockheed's corporate communications and security organization will be combined with human resources, while the corporate development unit will become part of corporate strategy and business development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; censerm@washpost.com &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author></author><abstract>According to the GAO -- which made its decision in October and released the decision earlier this month --</abstract><title>SRA holds off on layoffs (Posted 2013-01-13 22:36:05):Â GSA rethinking FDIC contract previously awarded to CSC</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1269001348?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jan 13, 2013</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1269001348</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
