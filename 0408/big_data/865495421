<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Paul Mansky, the top-rated analyst in the computers and office equipment sector, has a favorite adage: The good things are rarely as good as you think they are at the time, and the bad things are rarely as bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even in hindsight, though, Mr. Mansky had a good year in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 40-year old analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc.'s Canaccord Genuity division takes a thematic approach to his picks. Last year, he benefited greatly when many of the companies in his chosen theme -- storage technology -- were acquired at big premiums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His best pick of the year? That was Netezza Corp., which he upgraded to a buy in late March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Mansky says that "Netezza represented the best in class in an emerging new category [in information technology]: &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; -- and data warehousing in particular -- that offers hope to be disruptive," meaning it has the potential to transform the industry. The fundamentals of the company helped make it "an easy call," he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, International Business Machines Corp. announced its intent to buy Netezza for $27 a share, and Mr. Mansky moved his rating to hold. Investors who followed Mr. Mansky's buy recommendation scored a 121% return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two of his other picks in the storage space were solid, and while they would have helped investors avoid some losses, they failed to capture much in the way of gains. In April 2010, he downgraded his ratings on 3PAR Inc. and Compellent Technologies Inc. to sell from hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We entered the year pretty favorably disposed to storage," he says, noting that businesses had been on a buying spree for the systems. "But as we got into February we started to hear from demand checks that things were slowing down." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between his early-April downgrade and late July, when he returned both companies to a hold, 3PAR declined 3.8% and Compellent fell 22%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal fireworks in the storage industry began in August, when Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. got into a public bidding war for 3PAR. H-P won that contest, but Dell countered by buying Compellent later in the year. During the time he had a hold rating on the pair, 3PAR saw a nearly threefold return and Compellent returned 57%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Mansky didn't arrive at his position as an analyst the typical way. Fresh out of college, he landed a job managing large-donor relations for the Texas Republican Party. He says it seemed like a good way to meet influential people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy worked: Soon he had an entry-level job at Austin's only research house, one that included answering phones during the receptionists' lunch break. His two mentors were a technology expert and a finance fanatic, and he learned from them the importance of both types of fundamentals when evaluating a company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Mansky thinks storage will continue to be a hot area this year. He likes NetApp Inc., although "we think they have another bumpy quarter ahead of them." The company has been hiring aggressively, is heading into a traditionally slower quarter and has some tough comparisons coming up, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Mansky also likes networking companies Juniper Networks Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Ben Worthen &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Worthen, Ben</author><abstract>Mr. Mansky says that "Netezza represented the best in class in an emerging new category [in information technology]: big data -- and data warehousing in particular -- that offers hope to be disruptive," meaning it has the potential to transform the industry.</abstract><title>Best on the Street (A Special Report): 2011 Analysts Survey --- Computers &amp; Office Equipment</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/865495421?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>May 10, 2011</pub_date><pq_doc_id>865495421</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
