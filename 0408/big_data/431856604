<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; As the trading rituals of capitalism re-established themselves yesterday, individual investors watched the sobering saw-toothed lines of the indexes and the ever-tumbling prices, feeling the apprehension of badly shaken markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some bought, especially in the morning, and many others abruptly sold. But, to a large extent, they waited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ''It wasn't a day to trade,'' said Lorraine Trapp, who works in New York in the circulation department of a magazine. ''It just wasn't.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friends had suggested that she buy, and told her to look at this stock, that stock. ''I want to wait,'' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the first opportunity since the terrorist attack for Americans  to wade into the stock market and buy, sell or do nothing at all. Throughout the last week, even as the subject of the idle markets increasingly crept into news reports trying to gauge the ramifications of the devastation, it seemed crass to think about money. What mattered was life itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the opening of the stock exchanges yesterday, after four days of suspended trading, there was no avoiding the subject. Individuals had to make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even as the Dow Jones industrial average shrank by hundreds of points and the Nasdaq found itself rudely battered, many individuals remained remarkably calm and unflinching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tragic context in which the trading took place was so extraordinary that perhaps never before would an individual investor have spoken of the Dow as did Gordon Morlan, 65, a retired teacher in Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.: ''We were concerned to see it dip 600 points. But, on the other hand, I consider that to be a reasonable adjustment.''  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly there were people who sold, some compelled by margin calls to put up more cash, after shares they had bought with borrowed money plunged in value, and others simply wishing to return money to safer refuges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were still others who bought, out of an expanded sense of patriotism or because they sniffed bargains. But interviews with investors around the country indicated that the prevalent sentiment in one of the market's riskiest days was to hold fast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Pocahontas, Ark., Henry McNabb, 42, was up and ready at 6 a.m. for the market opening at 8:30 Central time, giving him hours of time to worry. In the office of his funeral home -- outside, American flags were draped from the 12 light posts that lined the parking lot -- he clicked on the television and channel-surfed among CNBC, ABC, NBC and CBS, absorbing market intelligence as fast as it was broadcast. He switched on his computer and logged onto an Internet stock quote service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was ready for action. But as the markets commenced their relentless downward path, he was a study in inaction. He did not activate his Charles Schwab account. He did not send a sell order. ''I'm a little bit encouraged,'' he said, even as the averages sank by 5 percent right at the start. ''I'm just watching, hoping and praying we recover, hoping we don't go into a depression.''  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patrick O'Byrne, 33, and his wife, Geri, are saving to buy a house in Bergen County, N.J. They have money in three mutual funds, all of it earmarked for their down payment. On Sunday night, they compared thoughts about what to do when the markets reopened. They seriously thought about pulling out, but ultimately decided to do nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ''I think a lot of people are just scared and want to take their money and put it in a pillowcase,'' Mr. O'Byrne said. ''I don't blame anyone for looking out for their own interests financially, their own concerns, but I am confident that we will recover.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leong Joe Tsung, 40, a production worker at AOL Time Warner who lives in Princeton, N.J., has a substantial investment portfolio, 100 percent of it in stocks. He, too, took no action yesterday. ''I don't want to take advantage of the situation,'' he said. ''Today is not a day to be doing much with money.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nikolaos Monoyios, a portfolio manager for OppenheimerFunds who escaped the World Trade Center last week and took up an office in central New Jersey, was asked by his 22-year-old daughter whether she should buy stocks to display her patriotism. Mr. Monoyios advised her against acting on her emotions. ''Just do nothing,'' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was so much information to digest and make sense of. There was the Federal Reserve slicing interest rates, the parade of companies promising to buy back their own shares, the repeated calls over the weekend to buy, or at least not sell, out of patriotic resolve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While many investors felt patriotism did not necessarily extend to stock market activity, others were moved by the messages. ''We owe it to the memory of the people who were killed not to sell stock,'' said David Grossberg, an independent businessman from Albertson, N.Y. ''I'm not selling at all. I find it offensive.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or, as JoAnn Kelly, a retired banker who lives in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., said: ''We are sitting tight. We basically feel that if people panic, then that hurts all of us.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fidelity, the big investment house, said call volume was high but below what was expected, that buy orders exceeded sell orders, and that ''people were very measured.'' Vanguard mobilized 300 members of its ''Swiss Army,'' a contingent of former and current workers, including the company's chief executive, John J. Brennan, to assist taxed phone operators. The flow of calls was heavy in the morning, but then most of the Swiss Army was disbanded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were any number of individuals who could not cope with another day of worry. An investor in his mid-50's, who asked not to be identified because he had just learned that a friend had died in the World Trade Center collapse, was at the Schwab office in Rockefeller Center before the market opened because he wanted to move his portfolio of about $250,000 from a stock mutual fund into a money market fund. He had left the money planted in stocks during the gyrations of the past, but had reached his limit of tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ''It's lower earnings but it's lower risk,'' said the investor, who is semiretired after having been laid off last year. ''When you have worked for 30 years for your money, you don't want it to evaporate in a day.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others plunged in and bought. Todd Shapiro, who owns a public relations firm in Hauppauge, N.Y., bought 100 shares of I.B.M. and 500  of AOL Time Warner when the market was down 600 points. ''I think it's important now to support our economy in time of need,'' he said. ''It was an unbelievable buying opportunity. Like our country, the market will be back stronger than ever.''  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Mannino, 47, who owns a restaurant marketing company in Broomall, Pa., also saw opportunity. ''G.E. is trading in the low 30's; they're practically giving it away,'' he said. ''I was waiting for a climate to give me a signal that it was time to expand my G.E. position, and now I can.''  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Milwaukee, Gregory Mews checked stock quotes on a cellphone as he worked. Mr. Mews, 48, is the assistant manager of a Walgreens and the treasurer of a small investment club. Before the attack, the club's account had dwindled to $525,000 from $750,000 at the start of last year. But at a meeting on Thursday, the members decided that terrorist strikes would not cause them to shrink from the stock market. They voted to buy additional shares of EMC, the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; storage company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some other investors, hard as it may seem to believe, tuned out entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Croskery, a 68-year-old retired clergyman who lives in Cincinnati, has money in about 40 stocks, about half of them blue chips like Eli Lilly and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble. Fortunately, he did have a longstanding rule of never investing in airlines, which were particularly savaged in yesterday's trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only did he not buy or sell yesterday, he did not even turn on the television or the radio to check on the market's decimation. ''I'm concerned,'' he said. ''But I'm invested in what I believe are quality issues.''  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he would wait until he got today's newspaper to see how the market did. In the meantime, he washed his car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Martin J. Whitman, chairman of Third Avenue Trust, wore a denim shirt and fleece vest at the company's offices yesterday. (Marilynn K.
