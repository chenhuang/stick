It found that about two-thirds of those surveyed believe &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; - chunks of information too large to be easily managed by typical computer programs - could fundamentally transform federal operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet, a much smaller share - about 37 percent - said their agency is taking the right steps to leverage &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; to improve agency operations. Eighteen percent of managers reported they have full professional proficiency in understanding large data sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of those questioned cited inadequate resources, technological barriers and misaligned budget priorities as impediments to federal progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Marjorie Censer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOCAL FIRMS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bode Technology names new CEO &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bode Technology Group of Lorton announced last week that Michael Cariola is the company's chief executive and president, taking over for Barry Watson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cariola was chief operating officer of Bode, which works with law enforcement and other government agencies to provide forensic DNA-collection products as well as analysis and research services. It also operates a DNA laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson retired but will remain a senior adviser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Marjorie Censer &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author></author><abstract></abstract><title>IT Digest: U.S. agencies slow to adopt big data; Bode names new chief executive</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321934342?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Apr 1, 2013</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1321934342</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
