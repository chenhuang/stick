<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; When looking for workers to staff its call centers, Xerox Corp. used to pay lots of attention to applicants who had done the job before. Then, a computer program told the printer and outsourcing company that experience doesn't matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software said that what does matter in a good call-center worker -- one who won't quit before the company recoups its $5,000 investment in training -- is personality. Data show that creative types tend to stick around for the necessary six months. Inquisitive people often don't. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some of the assumptions we had weren't valid," said Connie Harvey, Xerox's chief operating officer of commercial services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a half-year trial that cut attrition by a fifth, Xerox now leaves all hiring for its 48,700 call-center jobs to software that asks applicants to choose between statements like: "I ask more questions than most people do" and "People tend to trust what I say." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more and more companies, the hiring boss is an algorithm. Jobs that were once filled on the basis of work history and interviews are left to personality tests and data analysis. Under pressure to cut costs and boost productivity, employers are trying to predict specific outcomes, such as whether a prospective hire will quit too soon, file disability claims or steal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personality tests have a long history in hiring. What's new is the scale. Powerful computers and more sophisticated software have made it possible to evaluate more candidates, amass more data and peer more deeply into applicants' personal lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some companies are screening for such variables as attitudes toward alcohol use or the distance an applicant lives from the job. The process could get companies into legal trouble if it ends up excluding minorities or the disabled. Even if it doesn't, it might come off as unfair, or even creepy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new hiring tools are part of a broader effort to gather and analyze employee data. Globally, spending on so-called talent-management software rose to $3.8 billion in 2011, up 15% from 2010, according to research firm Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big tech companies are jockeying to serve the growing market. Last month,International Business Machines Corp. agreed to pay $1.3 billion for Kenexa Corp., which uses data analysis to help companies recruit and retain workers. Oracle Corp. acquired job-applicant tracking system company Taleo for $1.9 billion in February, andSAP AG bought SuccessFactors, which specializes in performance tracking, recruiting and compensation, for $3.4 billion in December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xerox is being advised by Evolv Inc., a San Francisco start-up. By putting applicants through a battery of tests and then tracking their job performance, Evolv has developed a model for the ideal call-center worker. The data say that person lives near the job, has reliable transportation and uses one or more social networks, but not more than four. He or she tends not to be overly inquisitive, but is creative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Applicants for the job take a 30-minute test that screens them for personality traits and puts them through scenarios they might encounter on the job. Then the program spits out a score: red for low potential, yellow for medium potential or green for high potential. Xerox accepts some yellows, but mostly hires greens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though hiring is a crucial business function, conventional methods are remarkably short on rigor, experts say. Depending on who decides, what gets candidates hired can vary wildly -- from academic achievement to work experience to appearance. Managers who go with their gut might get it right sometimes, but their hunches generally have little value in predicting how someone will perform on the job. Companies peddling a statistical approach to hiring say they can improve results by reducing the influence of a manager's biases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laszlo Bock, a senior vice president at Google Inc. and an Evolv director, said software will supplement, if not supplant, many of the personnel decisions long made by instinct and intuition. "Over the years this can help companies pick who to advance, who to promote," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It isn't just big companies that are turning to software for hiring help. Richfield Management LLC, a Flint, Mich., waste-disposal firm that employs 200 garbage collectors, was looking for ways to screen out applicants who were likely to get hurt and abuse workers' compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a year and a half ago, Richfield turned to an online test developed by a small firm called Exemplar Research Group. It asks applicants to pick between statements like "When I'm working for a company I take pride in making it as profitable as possible" and "I'm only concerned with how well I can do financially in my job," then rate how strongly they agree or disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who score poorly are considered high disability risks. Richfield said its workers' comp claims have fallen 68% since it has used the test, and it now requires managers to use it to eliminate unsuitable applicants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data-based hiring can expose companies to legal risk. Practices that even unintentionally filter out older or minority applicants can be illegal. If a hiring practice is challenged in court as discriminatory, a company must show the criteria it is using are proven to predict success in the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matthew Camardella, a partner at law firm Jackson Lewis LLP, specializes in determining whether companies are in compliance with equal opportunity laws. He said an increasing number of them are asking him to evaluate new software tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bigger data sets can raise the risks of violating the law by increasing the number of statistical relationships that could unwittingly screen out protected groups, he said. But they also could make it easier to prove the factors being measured are relevant to the job being filled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evolv is cautious about exploiting some of the relationships it turns up for fear of violating equal opportunity laws. While it has found employees who live farther from call-center jobs are more likely to quit, it doesn't use that information in its scoring in the U.S. because it could be linked to race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kenexa, which tested 30 million applicants last year, asks applicants for call-center and fast-food jobs to describe their commute by picking options ranging from "less than 10 minutes" to "more than 45 minutes." The longer the commute, the lower their score for these jobs, says Jeff Weekley, who oversees the assessments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bon-Ton Stores Inc. began using Kenexa in 2009 to screen applicants for hourly wage jobs. The retailer was looking in part to weed out candidates who might steal or miss work due to injury, said Denise Domian, senior vice president for human resources. Kenexa's 40-minute survey, she said, asks questions that the software scores for honesty. "People who are trying to fool the system are going to get tripped up," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emily Glazer contributed to this article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (See related article: "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt; Upends the Way Workers Are Paid" -- WSJ September 20, 2012) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subscribe to WSJ: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Joseph Walker &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Walker, Joseph</author><abstract>Last month,International Business Machines Corp. agreed to pay $1.3 billion for Kenexa Corp., which uses data analysis to help companies recruit and retain workers.
