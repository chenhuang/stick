<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; After a two-year-study, the Federal Trade Commission today called for Congress to pass legislation to protect privacy in the digital era and urged brokers who buy and sell names, addresses and other personal information to give consumers the right to see their data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency's 57-page report on privacy is the result of two years of discussions with commercial data collectors and privacy advocates--and are only non-binding recommendations. The FTC is not setting privacy rules but will bring enforcement actions against companies that engage in "deceptive" or "unfair" practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, the agency's report is largely aimed at persuading companies to agree to voluntarily agree to adopt privacy "best practices." That allows the agency to crack down on companies that are deceptive in their promises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the online industry advertising industry voluntarily agreed to one of the FTC's main privacy recommendations--the development of a do-not-track mechanism that would let users click limit Web tracking using a single setting in their Web browsing software. Previously, the industry had been urging consumers to individually "opt out" of more than a hundred different companies that track Web browsing behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are confident that consumers will have an easy to use and effective Do Not Track option by the end of the year because companies are moving forward expeditiously to make it happen and because lawmakers will want to enact legislation if they don't," Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the FTC, said in a prepared statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newly issued report suggests that &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; brokers should make it easier for people to see their data by developing a centralized website that would allow people to view all the entities that hold their data. The agency also called for the passage of a law that would require data brokers to allow people to view their data and correct inaccurate information (which is currently not required by law). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency also urged companies offering mobile services to voluntarily improve privacy protections. The report cited a Wall Street Journal study from 2010 that revealed that many smartphone apps exposed personal details about their users. The Journal's examination of 101 apps showed 56 sent the phone's unique device ID to other companies without users' awareness or consent, and 47 sent location information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FTC Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch dissented from the 3-1 vote approving the report. His objections included the fact that the definition of "Do Not Track" has not been finalized and that the "best practices" framework are not entirely voluntary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Julia Angwin at  julia.angwin@wsj.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Julia Angwin &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Angwin, Julia</author><abstract>After a two-year-study, the Federal Trade Commission today called for Congress to pass legislation to protect privacy in the digital era and urged brokers who buy and sell names, addresses and other personal information to give consumers the right to see their data.</abstract><title>FTC Urges Congress to Pass Digital-Privacy Law</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/940873619?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Mar 26, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>940873619</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
