<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; COMPUTER enthusiasts are a generous lot, generous with their time and information, and eager, sometimes to a fault, to share their hard-won knowledge with others. A recent column here of excerpts from readers' letters brought an outpouring of advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard M. Gummere Jr. of Barrytown, N.Y., had asked about getting software for his "wood-burning" old Kaypro computer, which uses the now-eclipsed CP/M operating system. Well, like a star from the days of black-and-white movies, the Kaypro may be faded, but it still has its admirers, and even lovers. (A friend still imagines going on a date with Alexis Smith.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  John D. White of Islip, L.I., writes: "Mr. Gummere can order CP/M software from Elliam Associates, Box 2664, Atascadero, Calif. 93423; telephone (805) 466-8440. They ask a SASE for a flyer, $1 for a catalogue, and $8.50 plus $2 shipping and handling for a more extensive public domain catalog. More direct and personal help can be obtained from the Creative Computing Club in Manhattan, c/o Dr. Douglas Margolis at 153 East 57th Street, No. 8-G, New York, N.Y. 10022. Doug and his group generously support Kaypro, CP/M and MS-DOS users of all ability levels." Dr. Margolis also wrote to volunteer help, adding that "it is still possible to get the Wordstar word-processing program, version 4.0, in a number of CP/ M formats, direct from Wordstar International at (800) 227-5609."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael C. Miller, M.D., of Boston has different advice: "Simply getting a new machine may be simpler than finding CP/M software for his Kaypro. A used PC/XT or even a PC with an 80286 processor could cost him very little money ($200 to $400), even with a small hard drive. With 20 megabytes of space and a copy of Wordperfect or Xywrite -- almost any version would do -- he is likely to be very happy. He might even be happy without the hard drive and get away very cheap ($100). The Boston Computer Exchange, (617) 542-4414, would give him prices or he can look at local advertisements. The screen will be easier on his eyes (he might even get color) and we all know that Xywrite is the fastest word processor there ever was, even on those old PC's. But he is right: the Kaypro was a machine you could love."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another reader, Warren Allen Smith of New York, had asked about an "income-outgo program," as well as one for managing the affairs of a club. Dr. Miller says: "He does not need a program other than Intuit's Quicken, although he may need to upgrade to version 3. It has a net worth report which he will find in the report menu. This report will total all of his accounts and is the most direct route to the bottom line. Quicken 3 will also keep track of stock fluctuations, but they have to be entered by hand. It is very cumbersome if he has a large portfolio. I would ask, is this the way he wants to be spending his time!" On managing a club, Dr. Miller adds: "The easy-to-use database program Filemaker Pro (from Claris, a subsidiary of Apple Computer Inc.) will do everything he wants, but he may have to read the manual. He will even be able to share his data with club members who have Windows machines." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Martin Tittle of Ann Arbor, Mich.: "I suggest he order Managing Your Money from Macconnection in New Hampshire ($44) for his income-outgo/balance sheet needs." Unsurprisingly, Robert E. Polley, of MECA Software, which publishes Managing Your Money, also suggests that program, whose full title is Andrew Tobias's Managing Your Money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dana Peck of Portland, Ore., had commented on the effectiveness of physically transferring files from one computer to another (the sneaker net), rather than sending them electronically. Dr. Miller says, "Sneaker net still is the fastest form of communication in my house, too. My 4-year-old son holds the record here." And a reader signing himself or herself as "anonymous I.B.M.er No. 896" remembers "conversations we had years ago at I.B.M. in the mid-Hudson Valley," adding, "There was frequent discussion about installing permanent land lines between I.B.M.'s big plants at Kingston, Poughkeepsie and Fishkill, and the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; processing site at Sterling Forest. The show stopper was always the realization that nothing could touch the bandwidth of the Friday afternoon station wagon to Sterling Forest filled with mag tapes." Love Affair With Mac &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Arguably the best introduction to the Macintosh has been issued in a third edition. "The Little Mac Book," by Robin Williams (Peachpit Press; $16), should be bought when you buy a Macintosh, even if it's not your first. It is one woman's account of her love affair with the computer: "Well, as far as technical stuff goes, all most of us need to know is the machine is magic. Pure, simple, magic. Like an airplane." There is plenty of "technical stuff" too, but made easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Little Mac Book," third edition, may be ordered from the publisher at (800) 283-9444 or (510) 548-4393.   &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times ,Â Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>Shannon, L R</author><abstract>Dana Peck of Portland, Ore., had commented on the effectiveness of physically transferring files from one computer to another (the sneaker net), rather than sending them electronically.
