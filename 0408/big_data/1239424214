<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Oracle Tries to Peer Through the Cloud &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The forecast for Oracle: Cloudy with a chance of hardware. Sun will appear hazy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle Corp. didn't bet the farm on hardware in 2009 when it bought ailing Sun Microsystems Inc. And, in fact, the deal seems to have generated decent returns. But Oracle still has lagged behind the total performance of the Nasdaq-100 by a little over 25%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The engineered systems that combine Oracle's software and hardware may be overshadowed when the company on Tuesday reports second-quarter results for fiscal 2013. Oracle is likely to put some more emphasis on its initiatives in cloud computing, software delivered over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts polled by FactSet expect Oracle to report earnings per share of 48 cents for the period ended in November, versus 43 cents a year earlier. The results should be boosted by a big jump in software-license revenue, according to Credit Suisse analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They see growth of nearly 11% versus a year ago in what is typically the strongest period for such sales. Last year, Oracle disappointed with similar growth of just 2.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In discussing the cloud, Oracle may include some mention of Skire, Xsigo, Taleo and DataRaker, some recent acquisitions in this area. The cloud is both friend and foe for Oracle. It is an opportunity too large to ignore but also an avenue for smaller, nimbler competitors to steal software customers. For now, software remains Oracle's bread and butter, and smaller rivals are just nipping at its heels. The year the Sun deal closed, software license and support sales dropped to 67% of revenue. But that is seen recovering to nearly three-quarters again by 2015. And it produced some 87% of operating income last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The largest, most lucrative and reliable part of both software and hardware revenue comes from "continuing support." That is a powerful, annuitylike business. But investors will fret if new licenses slow as that could lead to lower future service revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; License sales did briefly slip after a sales-force reorganization by President Mark Hurd, who joined after a stormy exit from Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2010. If his salesman's touch is intact when Oracle reports earnings, shareholders should set aside doubts about the clouds hanging over &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; for now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subscribe to WSJ: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a name="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Spencer Jakab &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Jakab, Spencer</author><abstract>Oracle Corp. didn't bet the farm on hardware in 2009 when it bought ailing Sun Microsystems Inc.
