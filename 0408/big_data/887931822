<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp. Chief Executive Samuel J. Palmisano came to Silicon Valley last month and met with venture-capital firms to explore how to take advantage of shifts in "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;," becoming the latest tech executive to tap the connections of early-stage investors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a private breakfast meeting with about half a dozen venture capitalists at a Menlo Park hotel, and then in a larger private meeting with more than 50 people the same day, Mr. Palmisano stressed the importance of IBM's partnership with the venture-capital community and discussed working together to spur innovative technology, said IBM executives and people who attended the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Palmisano was treading a well-worn path of tech executives seeking to mine the knowledge of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who often spot new technologies before giants like IBM. Among other non-Silicon Valley tech firms, Microsoft Corp. has opened a Mountain View office to work with start-ups and venture capitalists, AOL Inc. has posted hiring billboards along Highway 101, and EMC Corp., Citrix Systems Inc. and Research In Motion Ltd. have all bought start-ups in the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you bring the star power of a Fortune 50 CEO, everybody responds yes," said Sharon Wienbar, managing director at Scale Venture Partners, who attended the IBM event. "There's a big draw in seeing someone at that level of operational excellence and strategic complexity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from Scale Venture Partners, other local venture firms that met with Mr. Palmisano included Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers, Greylock Partners, Emergence Capital Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has said it expects to spend $20 billion on acquisitions between 2011 and 2015. The Armonk, N.Y., company has focused for several years on "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;," the advancement in data-storage capacity, processing power and analytical ability that has begun to transform industries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM Vice President Rod Smith said venture-backed start-ups can help IBM's &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="hit"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; push because "we can't do it all. We're seeing a lot of start-ups. It's a nice, big ocean, and we know we can float a lot of boats." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's music to the ears of many Silicon Valley venture capitalists, whose firms partly profit from sales of their start-ups to tech buyers. "IBM has a culture that fits pretty well with Silicon Valley," said Bessemer's Byron Deeter, who previously sold a start-up at which he worked to IBM. "When people think about who they want to sell to and see their baby proliferate through, IBM is a great buyer in that regard." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Deborah Gage &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Gage, Deborah</author><abstract>In a private breakfast meeting with about half a dozen venture capitalists at a Menlo Park hotel, and then in a larger private meeting with more than 50 people the same day, Mr. Palmisano stressed the importance of IBM's partnership with the venture-capital community and discussed working together to spur innovative technology, said IBM executives and people who attended the meeting.</abstract><title>Bay Area -- The Valley: IBM Visits 'Big Data' Arena</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/887931822?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Sep 8, 2011</pub_date><pq_doc_id>887931822</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
