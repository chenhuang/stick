<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Harry Shearer is the host of the weekly radio broadcast ''Le Show.''  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT'S at least arguable that America's only true indigenous art form is industrial music, the anthems and mini-musical productions that corporations commission to impress clients and bludgeon sales forces into action. After all, people in other countries have mastered jazz, rap and gospel. Nobody on another continent has yet achieved the delicate balance of peppiness, boosterism and dementia that industrial music demands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, the Web site zdnet.co.uk/specials/2002/it-anthems/ has become popular for keeping a Top 20 chart of the I.M. commissioned by I.T. (information technology) firms. Some of the more robust lyrics from that site are offered here, along with a couple of vintage compositions from my personal collection (which can be heard on the Web at nytimes.com/weekinreview/).   HARRY SHEARER &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KPMG International &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The accounting firm, no Arthur Andersen, goes for a soulful ballad in praising its bordlerless potency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KPMG, we're strong as can beA team of power and energy&lt;br/&gt; We go for the gold&lt;br/&gt; Together we hold onto our vision of global strategy.&lt;br/&gt; KPMG, we're strong as can be&lt;br/&gt; A dream of power and energy&lt;br/&gt; We go for the gold&lt;br/&gt; Together we hold onto our vision of global strategy.&lt;br/&gt; We create, we innovate,&lt;br/&gt; We pass the ones that are la-a-ate.&lt;br/&gt; A global team, this is our dream of success &lt;br/&gt; that we create.&lt;br/&gt; We'll be No. 1, with effort and fun, &lt;br/&gt; Together each of us will run for gold,&lt;br/&gt; that shines like the sun in our eyes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Westinghouse Electric &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The former appliance giant tried to instill dealer pride back in 1957, with some history lessons set to a calypso beat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington, he come backFrom ice-cold Valley Forge,&lt;br/&gt; All the people they say&lt;br/&gt; You've done a fine job, George.&lt;br/&gt; He got cheers and applause from the mob.&lt;br/&gt; They gave him the presidential job.&lt;br/&gt; But was Georgie happy?&lt;br/&gt; No, he sob.&lt;br/&gt; Why?&lt;br/&gt; Because -- everybody! -- &lt;br/&gt; He got no Westinghouse franchise.&lt;br/&gt; He got no Westinghouse franchise.&lt;br/&gt; He won the war, but him got no store.&lt;br/&gt; And that's why the tears stay in his eyes.&lt;br/&gt; When Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;br/&gt; Came back from across the sea,&lt;br/&gt; He was joyous, he was greeted by the G.O.P.&lt;br/&gt; They say, ''Ike, you were such a great hit,&lt;br/&gt; We think in the White House you should sit.''&lt;br/&gt; But was Ike happy? Not a bit.&lt;br/&gt; Why? Because -- everybody! -- &lt;br/&gt; He got no Westinghouse franchise,&lt;br/&gt; He got no Westinghouse franchise.&lt;br/&gt; He won the war, but him got no store,&lt;br/&gt; And that's why the tears they're in his eyes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McKinsey &amp;amp; Company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consulting firm goes Bollywood-meets-Soca in saluting itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're MCKC, McKinsey Knowledge CenterWe are MCKC, McKinsey Knowledge Center&lt;br/&gt; We are MCKC, McKinsey Knowledge Center&lt;br/&gt; We are MCKC, McKinsey Knowledge Center&lt;br/&gt; Na na naaaa na ni na-na-na ni na-na-na ni na&lt;br/&gt; Na na naaaa na ni na-na-na ni na-na-na ni na&lt;br/&gt; Na na naaaa na ni na-na-na ni na-na-na ni na&lt;br/&gt; Na na naaaa na ni na-na-na ni na-na-na ni na&lt;br/&gt; We've got ability, we've got power,&lt;br/&gt; MCKC works 24 hours!&lt;br/&gt; The work is worship and as fun as me to see&lt;br/&gt; That's what they call -- MCKC!&lt;br/&gt; Challenges, engages, nothing really fazes us&lt;br/&gt; Come hell or high water,&lt;br/&gt; You can always count on us.&lt;br/&gt; Challenges, engages, nothing really fazes us&lt;br/&gt; Come hell or high water,&lt;br/&gt; You can always count on us.&lt;br/&gt; MCKC, key star of our eyes&lt;br/&gt; Burning bright and shining in the skies.&lt;br/&gt; MCKC, key star of our eyes&lt;br/&gt; Burning bright and shining in the skies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pearl Brewing Company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Texas brewer had an optimistic quasi-Dixieland swing number back in the early 1970's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the year for this beautiful beerTo get more space on the rack&lt;br/&gt; To get on top of the stack&lt;br/&gt; Pearl's-a-poppin.&lt;br/&gt; Pop, pop, pop, pop, Pearl's a poppin.&lt;br/&gt; We've got all kinds of beer.&lt;br/&gt; We've got beers out the ears.&lt;br/&gt; So give three cheers and get off of your rears.&lt;br/&gt; Go sell the hell out of . . .&lt;br/&gt; You can excel out of . . .&lt;br/&gt; Sellin the hell out of Pearl's.&lt;br/&gt; Those Pearl's are a poppin&lt;br/&gt; And there's just no stoppin you now.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Honeywell &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The electronic controls company is extolled in a loping rock ballad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Showing pride and confidenceWith customers every day&lt;br/&gt; A partnership in business&lt;br/&gt; Builds trust along the way.&lt;br/&gt; Working all together&lt;br/&gt; In everything we do&lt;br/&gt; The future of our company&lt;br/&gt; Depends on me and you.&lt;br/&gt; Our vision is one Honeywell&lt;br/&gt; The future we can see&lt;br/&gt; We band together, spirits high&lt;br/&gt; At Honeywell, our quest is qualiteeeee!&lt;br/&gt; Investing in our future&lt;br/&gt; Learning from our past&lt;br/&gt; Finding ways to grow, within&lt;br/&gt; A world that's changing fast.&lt;br/&gt; Let's all make tomorrow&lt;br/&gt; Better than today.&lt;br/&gt; At Honeywell we'll do the job&lt;br/&gt; We'll find a better way!&lt;br/&gt; Our vision is one Honeywell&lt;br/&gt; The future we can see&lt;br/&gt; We band together, spirits high&lt;br/&gt; At Honeywell, our quest is qualiteeeee!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silicon Graphics &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The manufacturer of high-end work stations enlists an ethereal female voice to belt out this power ballad, with no royalties to the King family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a dream, and it's two C.P.U.'sWhat this will mean, is no more desktop blues.&lt;br/&gt; Modeling and rendering, designing analyzing&lt;br/&gt; I have one dream and it's called two C.P.U.'s.&lt;br/&gt; I have a dream, and it's called a crossbar switch.&lt;br/&gt; What this will mean is no &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; glitch.&lt;br/&gt; Peer-to-peer, have no fear&lt;br/&gt; Get data in and out of here&lt;br/&gt; Just with the flip of a switch.&lt;br/&gt; I have a dream and it's called a crossbar switch.&lt;br/&gt; Just sit me down right in front of you&lt;br/&gt; And show me all the things that I can do!&lt;br/&gt; I won't miss a trick, with your point and click&lt;br/&gt; You make me feel inspired!&lt;br/&gt; I can set the world on fire!!!!&lt;br/&gt; I have a dream, and it's called a graphics pipe.&lt;br/&gt; It really works and it's not just P.C. hype!&lt;br/&gt; Texturing convolving, visual revolving,&lt;br/&gt; Any media type.&lt;br/&gt; I have a dream, I have a dream,&lt;br/&gt; I have a dream and it's called . . .&lt;br/&gt; A graphics piiiii-iiiiipe!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Employee morale down?
