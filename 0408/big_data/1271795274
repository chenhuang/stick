<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; If you want a symbol of how technology is transforming corporate America, here's a good one: the chief information officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That position has been recast from the guy who worried about the internal data network to the man or woman now central to virtually every major decision a company makes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology, of course, is driving this revolution. CIOs now devise sales systems that connect the business to customers, R&amp;amp;D networks that link talent world-wide, and data tracking that guides complex supply chains. The job is so central to a company's success or failure that many CIOs--once denizens of the "back office"--now report directly to the top. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With that bigger role in mind, CIOs from some of the world's top companies met last week for the first CIO Network, a conference held in San Diego by The Wall Street Journal. Topics mirrored the scope of the job: how to drive innovation, wrestle "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" to the ground, sharpen management skills, fathom Washington policy and fight off cyberspying, among other subjects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because the CIO is the top cop on the beat, it's not surprising that hacking was a dominant topic. Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co., told the group that she spent eight hours grappling with the subject in a recent meeting of CEOs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When polled, 45% of the CIOs at the gathering said their companies had already been hacked. In private, the chief information officer of one multinational said this was a woeful understatement. "It's not possible," he said. "Probably 100% have been hacked--and they know it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CIOs had plenty to say on other matters. They favor iPhones over Android. They think the Obama administration has squelched innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, no surprise, they believe by a wide margin that the modern-day CIO should report to the CEO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By John Bussey &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Bussey, John</author><abstract>Topics mirrored the scope of the job: how to drive innovation, wrestle "big data" to the ground, sharpen management skills, fathom Washington policy and fight off cyberspying, among other subjects.
