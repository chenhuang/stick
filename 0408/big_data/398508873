<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Three years ago, Microsoft Corp. launched its most ambitious technological undertaking, Windows NT. The operating system was designed to be personal computing's new software foundation -- and the company's lever to pry open new corporate computing markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It bombed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite Herculean efforts, the new software was slow, didn't run many key programs and required six times more memory than most PCs had at the time. Microsoft, used to steamrolling competition in the PC market, found that it had little pull with executives in charge of corporate data networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Frankly, the company hyped NT way way too much," concedes Jim Allchin, the senior vice president in charge of the effort. "There was a huge letdown. . . . Some other companies would have said, `I give up.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft didn't, and the implications are beginning to roll through the computer industry. Windows NT has come from nowhere to capture nearly a fifth of the booming market for operating systems shipped on midrange computers called servers, and the company believes NT is now outshipping all rivals in the server business. The momentum, particularly on desktop machines, should accelerate Wednesday; Microsoft will release to production a long-awaited NT version offering the easy-to-use graphical appearance of the popular Windows 95. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the product whose initials originally meant "New Technology" and were once jokingly said to stand for "Not There" has suddenly become the most important weapon for maintaining the software giant's stunning growth. While the world's attention is fixed on the PC market and the Internet, Windows NT is Microsoft's Trojan horse to attack a $30 billion market for networks, databases and specialized application programs that keep big companies running. Microsoft's server-software business alone surged from $401 million to $1 billion for the year ended June 30, and should double again in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's huge, approaching an avalanche," says William Tauscher, chief executive officer of Vanstar Corp., a Pleasanton, Calif., company that sells and installs big computer systems at major corporations. "I don't ever have a customer discussion that's not about NT." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The competitive fallout from Windows NT's rebirth is likely to be widespread, and possibly devastating for some Microsoft competitors. Already, Windows NT is siphoning off new sales that might have gone to Novell Inc. and numerous backers of the rival operating system called Unix, including Sun Microsystems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc. Windows NT also will play a huge role in the battle over the Internet, in which Microsoft is vying with Sun and Netscape Communications Corp. to establish the most popular World Wide Web standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Windows NT's rise from the ashes is a potent symbol of Microsoft's maturation, although it must be noted that artificial dog droppings and eggbeaters played an important role. At a total development cost of close to $500 million, the program became a costly lesson that technology is necessary but not sufficient to penetrate new businesses. In particular, the renaissance of Windows NT required an extraordinary effort to link the company's technologists with the customers who would ultimately use their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, a primer: Like other operating systems, which control the basic functions of computers, Windows NT was designed to handle key internal housekeeping functions of machines, such as organizing how documents are stored and printed. But product-development leader David Cutler was asked to make a quantum leap beyond the Microsoft DOS and Windows systems used on most desktop PCs. The new system would get more power by crunching 32 bits of data at a time, rather than 16. It would run multiple programs at the same time; if one crashed, the others would keep going. It was expected to run all existing application programs, as well as a new generation that would exploit its unique attributes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Windows 95 and its predecessors run individual PCs and portables, Windows NT was designed to run anything from high-end desktop machines to refrigerator-sized computers that serve as data repositories for hundreds of workers. It currently comes in versions for workstations and servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One principal target was Novell, an Orem, Utah, company that sells server software to let PC users swap files and manage printing over a network. The other was Unix, a standard operating system that many computer makers use to run a broader variety of server programs, such as transaction systems that let clerks enter customer orders or sort employee records. NT was expected to do both jobs on the same piece of hardware, an important cost saving to some customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By all accounts, the four-year gestation of the Windows NT 3.1, the inaugural version, brought a 400-person development team close to mental meltdown. Windows NT 3.1 had a staggering 6.1 million lines of computer code and was agonizingly slow. In 1993, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates predicted the company would sell one million units in the first 12 months on the market; it wouldn't reach that mark until its third year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it quickly became evident that Windows NT's first version was a dud, Mr. Allchin, a highly regarded code designer with a trademark shock of white hair, was charged with rallying the burned-out troops. Many of them drifted away or became despondent as Windows 95 and other projects rose in stature at the company. The magnitude of the flop was brought home to Mr. Allchin at a companywide meeting in the fall of 1993, when Executive Vice President Steve Ballmer held up a laptop computer and boasted that he was still running Windows NT on it. Though designed as a gesture of support, that Mr. Ballmer felt compelled to make it at all also suggested that faith in the product was waning around Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In retrospect, Mr. Allchin believes, the team became cloistered so long that they had lost touch with the people who used it. Team members used computers with vast amounts of memory, so they didn't object when Windows NT required a whopping 24 megabytes. And virtually no one had any contact with customers who needed to run &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; centers around the clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a case of waking up from this blissful ignorance," Mr. Allchin says. "People had to realize that it wasn't going to sell the way it was." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To save NT, Mr. Allchin and other managers homed in on one key tactic: Setting up systematic links between engineers and customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Programmers took turns fielding customer calls for technical support, and traveled to company sites where Windows NT was being used. Using electronic mail, every member of the development team received a message from the field each time Windows NT won a bid from a big customer -- and each time it lost. Microsoft also began sending thousands of customers test copies, or "betas," of new versions of the program; a small group of these outside testers are polled by telephone to help Microsoft decide whether all bugs have been stamped out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Allchin clipped bad reviews of Windows NT from trade publications, and assigned members to ensure that the product would next be ranked tops in each category measured. "If I ever found someone who made a bad comment about NT in the press, we separately called that person," he says. "We did whatever it took to solve their problem." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company hired a special 16-member team of programmers to design special pieces of code whose only function is to wring tiny speed boosts from sections of the program. Mr. Cutler, a charismatic, hot-tempered figure who dabbles in driving race cars, last year found an additional prize to drive his team: A hand mixer and a bowl full of mock dog droppings, which are ceremoniously passed to the development manager whose team has the most bugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tactics paid off. Subsequent versions of Windows NT worked far better. Windows NT 4.0, though it has swelled to 16.5 million lines of code, runs up to eight times faster than the first version -- and uses one third less memory. A server that could once support 150 users now can serve 1,000 with the same response times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One new convert is Tandem Computers Inc., which makes industrial-strength computers and software that won't break down under heavy transaction loads. "We clearly are betting on NT," says Roel Pieper, Tandem's chief executive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? For one thing, faster Intel Corp. microprocessors are spawning powerful servers at attractive prices. In some cases, a $4,000 box can do work previously handled by machines costing $25,000 to $1 million. PC maker Compaq Computer Corp., for example, has created a big business in Windows NT servers; so have Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard, though they also sell proprietary Unix computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unix also can run on Intel machines, and it can scale up to much larger computers needed for big computing jobs. But Windows NT is easier for nontechnical people to install and operate, and has generated a broader array of server and desktop programs. Microsoft has also used not-so-subtle pressure to drum up more programs: A software company that puts out a program for Windows 95, and wants to use a Microsoft-approved logo on its packaging advertising that fact, must pass tests showing the program also works on Windows NT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With those lures, Microsoft's sales team, sometimes going around computer managers to individual company department heads, began racking up wins in the corporate world, in the brokerage business and a few other key industries. "It's been a hard-fought battle every step of the way," says Paul Maritz, a Microsoft vice president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft seems to be gaining the upper hand. General Motors Corp. is installing 8,500 Windows NT servers at car dealers around the country. One program on the system will allow customers to configure the car model they like on a PC screen, and compare it with comparable models from competitors; another helps locate cars at other dealers or in transit to meet customer orders, says Wayne Stein, an Electronic Data Systems Corp. director who has worked on the GM project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some companies skipped Windows 95 on their desktops to wait for the new version of Windows NT. Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco brokerage firm, has decided to install 1,300 Windows NT desktop machines. Larry Sikon, its director of technical services, estimates that Unix machines and software would have cost $2,000 more per desk. Another lure was the easy-to-use interface of the forthcoming Windows NT 4.0, comparable to the Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh systems it will replace. "For us it was a godsend, because it is so Mac-like," Mr. Sikon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By some measures, of course, Windows NT is just starting to get going. In 1995, market researcher International Data Corp. estimated that Windows NT had only 18.7% of all server operating-system shipments, while Unix machines collectively had 24% and Novell had 42%. Both rival systems continue to boost sales in the growing market, and have huge installed bases that won't go away soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But NT clearly has momentum. Unit shipments of the server version tripled to 450,000 for the year ended June 30, and Mr. Ballmer projects sales will nearly double to 840,000 units in the current year. The company believes it is already shipping servers at a faster rate than all versions of Unix combined. Novell insists it is still well ahead, but Mr. Allchin says the lead vanishes if you count only new installations of both companies' software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Internet could change the battle. Many companies are buying servers to dispense information in Web format to their employees and customers through in-house "intranets." Web browser programs can run on virtually any desktop computer, which could reduce pressure to rely on Microsoft's software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netscape, the top Web browser maker and a big force in Web servers, hopes Sun and its hot new programming language, Java, will create a new breed of programs that can be transferred over networks and run on any operating system, reducing the need to standardize on Windows NT or other operating systems. Though Windows NT is gaining ground fast, Sun's Unix-based computers account for the largest volume of Web servers; its executives say Java has Microsoft on the defensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not going to tell you NT is not going to be a success," says Ed Zander, president of Sun's computer business. But he says top corporate information officers sense a historic opportunity to get more choice than they have traditionally had from Microsoft. "They're telling me, `We want to be free from the lock-in of the Microsoft operating system,'" he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other customers, argues Mr. Tauscher at Vanstar, welcome Microsoft's plan to make Internet technology and other features a free element of the operating system. Windows NT 4.0 will include a new Web server and software for designing Web sites and indexing files in a more efficient way. Ethos Corp., a San Francisco startup company that offers a Web information service called InvestorsEdge, recently chose Windows NT and Microsoft's Web server simply because it was easy to use and, unlike Netscape, it was free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Netscape is still out there trying to sell their product," says Kevin Vaughn, vice president of advanced technology for HarperCollins Publishers, a News Corp. unit that also chose Windows NT. "That makes it very hard to compete with Microsoft." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To critics, Microsoft's pricing -- or lack of pricing, in this case -- is an unfair artifact of its monopoly in the PC market. But Mr. Gates shows no signs of slowing down. The company, with nearly $7 billion in the bank, plans to spend $2 billion on research and development in the current fiscal year -- a pace that would make it No. 8 among U.S. companies, though it won't make the top 100 in size. Profits should rise 18% to $2.6 billion in the current fiscal year, estimates analyst Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs, and revenues rise by the same percentage to $10.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hefty chunk of its resources will go into upgrading Windows NT, which Mr. Gates predicts will become powerful enough in two years to take on any computing job. "If we don't add these capabilities," he says, "other operating systems that do will over take our position." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1995 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1996 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; **Includes Windows NT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note: Fiscal years ended June 30 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources: Microsoft, Montgomery Securities &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Novell Knocks NT's Networking Services" -- WSJ Aug. 21, 1996) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By Don Clark</author><abstract>Microsoft didn't, and the implications are beginning to roll through the computer industry.
