<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Some years ago, an engineer at Google told me why Google was not collecting information linked to people's names: "We don't want the name. The name is noise." There was enough information in Google's large database of search queries, location and online behavior, he said, that a lot could be told about somebody through indirect means. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The point was that actually finding out people's names is not necessary for sending them targeted ads. But increasingly, everything about you is out there. Whether and how you guard your privacy in an online world we are building up every day has become urgent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   "Privacy is a source of tremendous tension and anxiety in &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;," said Danah Boyd, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research. Speaking last week at a conference at the University of California, Berkeley, she said, "It's a general anxiety that you can't pinpoint, this odd moment of creepiness." She asked: "Is this moving towards a society that we want to build?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   If conventional understanding chafes at the idea that our names are mere noise, consider the challenge in Ms. Boyd's point about the self in a highly networked society. Take personal genetic data. "If I give away data to 23andMe, I'm giving away some of my brother's data, my mother's data, my future kid's data." For that matter, "Who owns the e-mail chain between you and me?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Privacy is not a universal or timeless quality. Ms. Boyd sees only one certainty for which we should prepare. "Regulation is coming," she says. "You may not like it, you may close your eyes and hold your nose, but it is coming." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The issue is what the regulation looks like, and how well it is considered. "Technologists need to re-engage with regulators," she says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>Hardy, Quentin</author><abstract>Some years ago, an engineer at Google told me why Google was not collecting information linked to people's names: "We don't want the name.</abstract><title>Big Data Era And Privacy: [Business/Financial Desk]</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1019600176?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jun 11, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1019600176</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
