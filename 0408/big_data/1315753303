<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; I'm on my way to SXSW and bringing Ideas@Innovations with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some complain the conference, first held in 1987, has jumped the shark (although that discussion, too, appears to have jumped the shark back in 2011), becoming a large, crowded smorgasbord of ideas, pitches, marketing, concerts, parties, booze and, yes, breakfast tacos. There are more panels than one could possibly attend without the assistance of a time machine, since many convene simultaneously across Austin. And SXSW has become so big there's even an after-party-style conference of sorts in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wonder as we have on this blog as to the fate of the modern ideas conference, I can't wait to get there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm bringing a camera,laptop, wi-fi hotspot (not attached to a homeless person), water bottle and, in true analog journalist form, notebooks and pens. I've registered for the SXSW bikeshare program, and have asked more experienced friends which breakfast taco is the best breakfast taco, learning in one particularly informative e-mail exchange that, no, Taco Town is not a real place. I'll be attending only the Interactive portion of the conference and have been starring panel discussions, meet-ups and attendees on the internal social network. My calendar is a kaleidoscope of events, interviews and gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I asked Kay Koplovitz, founder of USA Networks and board chairman of Springboard Enterprises what she was most looking forward to doing. Aside from meeting with the entrepreneurs under Springboard's charge and connecting with new ones, she said she wanted to see MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's talk. But she can't. Her event is booked at the same time as Maddow's. Koplovitz will be presenting on a panel titled "Fighting for Funding as a Female Entrepreneur." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koplovitz said that to get the most out of the conference, attendees need a plan and to find the backbone to make tough choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you're just there to wander around," she said during a phone interview, "you're going to be disappointed. You really want to pick out the things that will be interesting to you." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In light of Koplovitz's advice, I went through the schedule and picked out my favorite panels based on their descriptions and speakers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; March 8 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMMA: The Next Big Thing Is Not a Gadget &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tales of US Entrepreneurship Beyond Silicon Valley &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New Nature vs. Nurture: &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp; Identity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imitation as Innovation: Lessons from the Shanzhai &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teaching Cheetahs: Disruptive Education in Africa &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron Swartz Town Hall* &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; March 9 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes to the Mess: Leadership Lessons from Jazz* &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leap Motion Experience &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond Mobile: Where No Geek Has Gone Before &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crowd-Sourcing the Space Frontier &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who Owns the Data?

When asked what he most wanted to accomplish at the conference he said, "I want to nudge our society back to having heroes again -- not heroes like Dennis Rodman, but heroes who are in the midst of these difficult disasters and kicking butt." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's leaning back and accepting that the experience is just going to be overwhelming and embracing that as the experience. Jason Best, co-founder and principal of Crowdfund Capital Advisors, said he wants to "get into a place and let [his] mind explode" for at least a moment. Best will be busy aside from that, signing his book "Crowdfund Investing for Dummies" and presenting along with his colleague Sherwood Neiss the panel "The Global Fight to Democratize Access to Capital." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Being able to turn people on to this ecosystem would be super awesome," said Best, of the crowdfund investing world, "there are going to be a ton of smart people packed into this 10-block radius." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll have my eye out for the emergence of trends, such as whether this South-by is a celebration of objects over apps, whether innovation in health-care apps can get beyond the exercise, sleep and calorie-monitoring variety and how far along we are in tackling the final frontier. And, of course, which breakfast taco is, indeed, the best breakfast taco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you will be at SXSW, please let us know.
