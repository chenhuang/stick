<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Five task forces at the CIO Network conference presented management and policy recommendations that chief information officers, other corporate executives and policy makers should pursue on subjects from getting ahead of disruptive technology to Washington's role in driving innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The full conference then voted these as the top five overall priorities: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. HARD-WIRE TO THE BUSINESS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs should be customer-focused and knowledgeable about the business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. CREATING A CULTURE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs should create a cultural appetite that accepts change, risks and failure, and understands that innovation can take time. Invite venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to talk to senior leadership and identify ways your business is going to be disrupted. Drive innovation; be the keeper of the forward view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. INFLUENCE WITH IMPACT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs must be able to effectively communicate. And they must understand the context of their organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. IMPROVE K-12 SCHOOLING &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Policy makers should rethink K-12 education, better exploiting technology and &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;, focusing on sciences and fitness at young ages, providing incentives for good teaching and using existing budgets more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 5. EMBRACE AGILITY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs should embrace "agile" techniques and management principles to be flexible, interactive and iterative. This helps increase transparency and, by sharing both pain and success with business units, deliver massive amounts of change that are increasingly needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subscribe to WSJ: &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Anonymous</author><abstract>Five task forces at the CIO Network conference presented management and policy recommendations that chief information officers, other corporate executives and policy makers should pursue on subjects from getting ahead of disruptive technology to Washington's role in driving innovation.</abstract><title>CIO Network (A Special Report) --- The CIOs' Top Priorities</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1271849207?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jan 22, 2013</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1271849207</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
