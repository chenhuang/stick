Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, declaring that GM doesn't "have time to lose," said he is accelerating and expanding cost-cutting efforts that have ruffled feathers in Detroit since his arrival last May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a free-wheeling meeting with reporters, Mr. Lopez, a Spaniard who ran European parts purchasing operations until May, declared himself "extremely pleased" with the success of his controversial cost-cutting efforts so far, and brushed off criticism from supplier-industry executives as the complaints of "losers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Lopez said he is having his staff take aim not just at suppliers of vehicle parts, but also at providers of services, such as advertising agencies and GM's &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; processing unit, Electronic Data Systems Corp. Their prices are being reviewed as part of a broad "overhead analysis" aimed at reducing GM's administrative costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly after GM President John F. Smith Jr. designated Mr. Lopez as his hit man in the war on GM's bloated costs, Mr. Lopez ordered virtually all of GM's contracts with suppliers reopened and rebid. GM buyers rattled suppliers with demands for double-digit price cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mr. Lopez yesterday played down the turmoil, saying "fewer than 25%" of the old contracts were ultimately shifted to a different vendor. Some internal GM parts operations lost contracts, Mr. Lopez added, without identifying which ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Lopez, a relentlessly optimistic man, declared that within a year all of the company's internal parts factories will be revamped to be low-cost, "lean" production systems -- a goal that has eluded GM executives for nearly a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yes, in the short term you reduce the number of jobs" by adopting lean production methods, Mr. Lopez acknowledged. "But the day you aren't competitive, you lose all the jobs." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Lopez argues that his initiative to reduce costs -- known as Picos, for Purchased Input Concept Optimization With Suppliers -- will eventually make GM's North American factories and suppliers as efficient as those of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. Mr. Lopez plans to send 1,000 of his Picos teams to coach GM subcontractors next year in manufacturing methods that are remarkably similar to those of Toyota, although Mr. Lopez bristles at that comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To illustrate what happens when one of Mr. Lopez's teams of Picos system coaches makes over a plant, the executive led a tour of a plant run by General Safety Corp., an independent seat-belt maker in suburban Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With GM's coaching, General Safety arranged simple assembly machinery into a circular "cell," where three workers performing several jobs each now produce as many seat belts as 13 workers and a $1.5 million semiautomated assembly line used to make. General Safety President Alfred J. Fisher III said he has kept all the displaced workers on the staff, thanks to new work coming from Ford Motor Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By Joseph B.
