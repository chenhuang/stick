<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Apple shares rose amid brisk demand for its newest iPhones, but Research In Motion stalled as its second-quarter earnings outlook disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, trading was relatively quiet despite the expiration of four types of futures and options contracts, known a "quadruple witching" day, as traders squared positions ahead of &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; due next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have the Federal Reserve meeting, Treasury auctions and some top-tier economic reports, including home sales and personal spending and income, that will help validate or nullify the idea that the economy is recovering," said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple rose $3.60, or 2.6%, to $139.48 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Customers lined up in front of Apple stores all over the country Friday morning to ensure that they would be among the first to receive the new 3G S smart phone. For the week, Apple shed 97 cents, or 4%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research In Motion (Nasdaq) fell 3.77, or 4.9%, to 72.78. First-quarter profit jumped 33%, as 3.8 million new BlackBerry subscribers were added, but revenue and customer growth was slightly below levels reached in the prior quarter. Shares fell 10.24, or 12%, for the week. Prior to this week, RIM had risen 16.35, or 24%, since mid-May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CarMax rose 2.22, or 17%, to 15.31. First-quarter earnings dropped much less than expected, as a slump in sales and increased losses at the car dealer's auto-finance unit were nearly offset by higher profit per vehicle sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cigna rose 1.58, or 6.7%, to 25.24; Coventry Health Care advanced 49 cents, or 2.7%, to 18.79; and Humana rose 95 cents, or 3.1%, to 31.59. Managed-care stocks continued rallying as analysts saw signs that a planned overhaul of U.S. health coverage may be less severe than initial proposals suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyndham Worldwide rose 1.10, or 9.8%, to 12.30. The time-share operator reiterated its second-quarter and full-year outlook, which were within Wall Street's expectations. Some analysts saw the announcement as a way to calm investor jitters after Thursday's announcement that Wyndham's chief financial officer is leaving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sasol's American depositary receipts fell 2, or 5.5%, to 34.18. The world's largest producer of motor fuels made from coal said it expects as much as a 50% decline in annual earnings because of lower crude-oil and chemical prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a name="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Karen Talley &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Talley, Karen</author><abstract>Managed-care stocks continued rallying as analysts saw signs that a planned overhaul of U.S. health coverage may be less severe than initial proposals suggested.</abstract><title>Large Stock Focus: Apple Rises 2.6%; RIM Sheds 4.9%</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/399125814?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jun 20, 2009</pub_date><pq_doc_id>399125814</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
