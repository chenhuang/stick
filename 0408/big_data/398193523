<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG expects sales to rise about 10% to 13 billion marks ($8.3 billion) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1991, from the previous year, executives of the recently merged concern forecast yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company official said it expects to turn a profit in its first fiscal year since the complex takeover of Nixdorf Computer AG by the big West German electronics group Siemens AG last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Munich-based Siemens controls around 78% of the post merger SNI, which consists of Nixdorf's operations as well as Siemens' &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; and information technology division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siemens DI sales grew 26% in the first 11 months of the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. In fiscal 1990, Siemens expects sales of its DI division to have risen to 7.5 billion marks from 5.4 billion marks a year earlier. Siemens DI expects a fiscal 1990 profit of about 300 million marks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By contrast, Frankfurt-based Nixdorf had a net group loss in 1989 of 1.07 billion marks on sales of 5.26 billion marks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Group pretax loss narrowed in the first half of 1990 to 266 million marks from 299 million marks in the first half of 1989. Combined Nixdorf-DI sales totaled 10.8 billion marks. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author></author><abstract>Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG expects sales to rise about 10% to 13 billion marks ($8.3 billion) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1991, from the previous year, executives of the recently merged concern forecast yesterday.</abstract><title>International Brief -- Siemens-Nixdorf: Merged Companies Expect Sales to Rise 10% for 1991</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/398193523?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Oct 2, 1990</pub_date><pq_doc_id>398193523</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
