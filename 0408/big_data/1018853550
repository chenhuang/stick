<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Chevron Uses '&lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt;' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To Cut Exploration Costs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. is hoping to reduce the cost of sending drillships used to extract oil from extremely deep waters by using sophisticated analytic tools to identify likely reservoirs of oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To find oil in places like the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron sends ships to survey areas suspected to contain oil or gas deposits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ships generate waves creating seismic data that is then converted into a picture that Chevron engineers can use to determine where oil is located. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is important that this picture is as clear as possible because drilling in deep water is expensive. Drillships cost roughly $1 million per day to operate, according to a September 2011 presentation by Peter Breunig, general manager of IT technology and architecture at Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is using open-source software called Hadoop to analyze "ridiculous amounts of data," according to Steve Walker, who works in data research, analytics and data warehousing at Chevron and spoke at a conference Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information collected is a correlation of five dimensions of data -- the x and y coordinates of the amplitude and arrival times of seismic waves sent to the ocean floor, as well as the time the data was collected -- one in 25 analytic steps Chevron takes to create a picture for engineers to use to locate oil reservoirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Walker said the company is investigating other uses for Hadoop, and predicts that within a few years, the entire energy industry will have embraced data science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Walker spoke at The Economist's Ideas Economy: Information conference in San Francisco, sponsored by Cloudera Inc., which helps companies implement Hadoop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doug Cutting, chief architect of Cloudera and co-creator of Hadoop, who also spoke at a the lunch, said "with oil companies, the more seismic data they have, the better they can find pockets of oil and natural gas underground." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One benefit of using Hadoop is that it can reduce the cost of seismic data processing by a factor of 10, according to a paper published by Cloudera in January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Rachael King &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NRG's Internal Social &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Network Actually Works &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies often experiment with using social networking tools to connect their employees -- who often grumble at the thought of such an initiative. But at NRG Energy Inc., employees are actually warming up to a new tool that lets them share information and collaborate on projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy Plus, a subsidiary of NRG, deployed a social network earlier this year that employees use to create ad hoc chat rooms which end up becoming stores of FAQs for later use on a specific topic, said Hugh Scott, the company's CIO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Scott's team has also used the tool to share software code and to get feedback from employees in the organization that need the tool the developers are creating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The social network -- called HipChat, from software vendor Atlassian -- was recommended to Mr. Scott by a member of his technology team after an earlier attempt at social networking using software from another company failed to catch on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Scott isn't sure why the previous experiment failed -- "literally nobody used it," he says -- but in retrospect, he thinks having launched HipChat without fanfare was important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Scott doesn't have any formal metrics to measure the new tool's success, but says he can tell it is working for two reasons. One, people are using HipChat as a verb, as in, "I'll HipChat you." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But also because the team had created a chat room called the "Nourishment" room they use to alert each other whenever there is free food in the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Michael Hickins &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIO Journal is a Wall Street Journal news service for business technology executives.
