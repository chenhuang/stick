<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; THE advertising business is like a proverbial three-legged stool, supported by agencies, the media and marketers. (Where are the consumers? Perhaps being milked by whoever sits on the stool.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it is not surprising that Madison Avenue is sharing the spotlight with marketers and media executives during Advertising Week 2012, which began in New York on Monday and continues through Friday. Indeed, some of the most popular sessions have been those featuring decision-makers from marketing and media companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For instance, a panel discussion on Wednesday, composed of marketing executives for three brands with large ad budgets -- Axe, Kia and Pepsi Max -- was standing room only. The attendance may have also been stimulated by the title, which, cleaned up, was something like "How the Heck Did They Sell That?"  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "sell" referred not to how agencies create ads to sell brands to consumers, but how marketing executives sell agencies' offbeat -- and sometimes off-putting -- ad ideas to their bosses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moderator, Jason Harris, president and chief executive at Mekanism, gave as an example a commercial with a wacky wizard that his agency created for Method laundry detergent. The company approved the spot because "the cost-to-weirdness ratio" was low, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the case of Axe, the Unilever line of personal-care products for younger men, the success of a rival, Old Spice, sold by Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, led to a willingness to consider alternative approaches.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A certain man appeared on a horse," said Joshua Dean, senior brand manager for Axe, referring to "The Man Your Man Could Smell Like," the oddball campaign for Old Spice, "and it made us think." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result was a "very, very different" campaign for Axe, Mr. Dean said, which took a softer, more sophisticated tack by presenting the actor Kiefer Sutherland reminiscing about a lost love and suggesting how Axe might have helped write a happier ending. The Axe creative agency is the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, part of the Publicis Groupe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sometimes with the work, especially if it's different, the agency needs to shake the client a bit and say, 'You need to do this,' " Mr. Dean said. And sometimes, he acknowledged, the work fails, but "if you never had a flop, you're not trying hard enough; it's what you can learn from it -- as long as it doesn't happen too many times." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Sprague, executive vice president for marketing and communications at Kia Motors America, discussed a successful campaign for the Kia Soul, created by the David &amp;amp; Goliath agency, using characters that are, improbably enough, hip, music-loving hamsters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kia was aiming the Soul at millennial consumers who "thought I was selling Swedish furniture, who thought I was Ikea," Mr. Sprague said. "What the hell do we have to lose?" The agency's ability to home in on those car buyers and understand their tastes in music, gaming and pop culture helped him sell the campaign, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Mr. Sprague offered a remark that drew some startled laughter from the audience. "Our agency does best when they're put under an incredible deadline pressure," he said. "Great ideas bubble up under stress." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a panel about the uses of so-called &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; in advertising, Scott Howe, president and chief executive at Acxiom, a marketing technology and services company, predicted that in the next five years advertisers will have to "stop thinking about media procurement and start thinking about data procurement."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Tim Cadogan, chief executive of OpenX, an ad technology company that uses data to serve digital ads, a potential area of concentration will be "improving the interaction of advertising and content," or what is known as native advertising.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marketers that interrupt consumers before they complete a task like reading an article online are sending messages at the wrong time, Mr. Cadogan said. Once a user completes the task "is the perfect time" to deliver messages they will be receptive to, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Battelle, executive chairman at Federated Media, described some brands as struggling to shift from traditional ad forms like commercials to having conversations with consumers on social media platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Brands don't have confident voices in real time," Mr. Battelle said. "When you see campaigns that appear ham-handed, it's probably because they were written by committee and cleared through legal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marketers are the target audience for a new initiative from Twitter, called sponsored surveys. Twitter executives briefed reporters on the introduction at an event on Wednesday. Sponsored surveys will enable marketers to ask Twitter users a handful of multiple-choice questions, like "Which brands do you associate with Fashion Week?" The surveys will appear as part of the promoted Twitter posts that users see in their newsfeeds, whether they are on computers or mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Bain, chief revenue officer at Twitter, said that survey marketing in the digital landscape, particularly on mobile devices, had "become a bigger pain point for marketing."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surveys will seek to take the place of interruptive surveys like the ones seen in pop-up screens when visiting certain Web sites, an experience that Mr. Bain described as "really disjointed" for users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kia's Popular Musicloving Hamsters.
