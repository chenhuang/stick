<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; An unprofitable business-technology start-up with a funny name turned in the best stock debut this year on Thursday, underlining how investors' appetite in the latest tech boom now extends beyond hot Web companies like Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Splunk Inc. -- which helps businesses organize and make sense of all the information they collect, a trend known as "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt;" -- soared 109% on the Nasdaq Stock Market, sending its market value above $3 billion. It was especially impressive given the broader stock market was down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first-day "pop" topped mobile-ad network Millennial Media Inc.'s 92% surge after its offering last month. It also matched the May 2011 debut of LinkedIn Inc., a professional-networking site that held the biggest Internet IPO since Google Inc. in 2004 and kicked off a frenzy of offerings from high-profile consumer Web companies including Groupon Inc., Zynga Inc., and soon, Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Start-ups like Splunk that are solving problems for businesses are seen as the next wave, even if they don't grab headlines the way companies whose websites are used by everyday people do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By the end of this calendar year, the general public will clearly understand that this big enterprise wave is beginning," said John Connors, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners and a Splunk board member. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Founded in 2004, Splunk set out to build a Google for machine data -- essentially a search engine for all the data that servers, network switches and any device such as smartphones with a processor spits out when those devices are in use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's name is a play on "spelunking," or caving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Automotive website Edmunds Inc., for instance, uses Splunk's software to organize the data generated by the thousands of interactions that take place on the site into information that executives can use to make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Businesses are increasingly counting on insight gleaned this way to improve the quality of their websites and the effectiveness of their advertising, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Splunk is capitalizing on an explosion of interest in &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt; as businesses generate more and more data sets that they need to collect, organize and analyze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While many large tech companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and EMC Corp. are now pushing similar data management and analytics products, Splunk is widely seen as the first pure play to go public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of January, Splunk had more than 3,700 customers, including Bank of America Corp., Comcast Corp., and Harvard University. The company charges an upfront license fee for its software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite its promise, Splunk has yet to reap a profit as it spends heavily to rev up its growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its loss widened to $11 million for the year ended in January, from $3.8 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is growing fast, though, with revenue rising 83% to $121 million for the fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market appears to be giving us a first-mover advantage on &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt;," Godfrey Sullivan, Splunk's chief executive, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Sullivan said a challenge for the company during the run-up to the IPO was making sure investors knew what the company actually does: "[E]veryone has heard of this term &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt; but no one really knows what that is and what it means. . .They have no idea what machine data is." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Sullivan's background certainly helped. Before joining Splunk in 2008, he was the CEO of software company Hyperion Solutions Corp., which he sold to Oracle Corp. for $3.3 billion in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Splunk's valuation in its first day as a public company came close to that figure, which Mr. Sullivan said surprised him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's nice to see that kind of welcome," he said. Mr. Sullivan's 7.1% stake is now worth about $243 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other winners include Splunk's venture-capital investors such as August Capital and Sevin Rosen, which each now own 17.7% of the company worth about $583 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Splunk's shares soared Thursday despite a technical glitch. Soon after Splunk began trading, the NYSE Arca said it was reviewing trades executed after a volatility halt was initiated in the stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The halt lasted from 11:20 a.m. to 11:25 a.m. EDT. Soon after, the NYSE Arca determined that all trades made during that five-minute halt would be canceled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two other business-oriented tech companies, Proofpoint Inc. and Infoblox Inc., have scheduled their IPOs for Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other enterprise tech companies with IPOs in the offing include tech-security firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Cowan, Jacob Bunge and Scott Denne contributed to this article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a name="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Ben Worthen &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Worthen, Ben</author><abstract>An unprofitable business-technology start-up with a funny name turned in the best stock debut this year on Thursday, underlining how investors' appetite in the latest tech boom now extends beyond hot Web companies like Facebook Inc.
