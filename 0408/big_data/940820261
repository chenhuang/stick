<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; SAS Institute, the world's largest private software company, has built its lucrative business by being the pioneer of sophisticated data-analysis tools. SAS software, down to its own programming language, is used by most large corporations for things like detecting credit card fraud for banks and fine-tuning pricing for retailers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   But the data-analysis game is democratizing. New kinds of data are part of the trend, as Web and social-networking messages join all the information in corporate databases as grist of decision making. But so are new tools, opening data-analysis to a wider audience of corporate users, not just elite teams of Ph.D. quants in Fortune 500 companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   SAS is making its bid on Thursday to grab a share of the widening market for data-analysis tools with a new product, SAS Visual Analytics. It takes mountains of data from structured corporate databases or Web sources, and presents it as easy-to-read charts, graphs and data maps. It can be accessed by mobile workers via a browser on their notebook PCs or through an iPad application. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The new user tool is delivered from SAS software that runs on an industry-standard blade server, with the hardware typically supplied by partners, Hewlett-Packard and Dell. It exploits the latest in very fast data-handling technology - so-called in-memory processing. That is, data is explored and sifted in a computer's memory almost instantly as opposed to having to retrieve information from a storage disk, which delays the response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The move by SAS, according to Dan Vesset, an analyst at IDC, shows that the company is keeping pace in technology for in-memory processing and user-friendly, visual software for users.  Its new product, Mr. Vesset said, is meant   to "appeal to the new generation of analysts and data scientists." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   SAS, based in Cary, N.C., faces plenty of competition from large companies in the field like I.B.M., Microsoft and MicroStrategy as well as smaller companies and start-ups including QlikTech, Tableau Software and ClearStory Data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The goal, simply put, is to create the equivalent of the spreadsheet for &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The SAS advantage, said Jim Goodnight, founder and chief executive, will be in bringing its leading-edge technology to more corporate managers. "No one has the predictive analytic tools that we have," Mr. Goodnight said. "And we can handle much, much larger data than anyone else."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>Lohr, Steve</author><abstract>SAS Institute, the world's largest private software company, has built its lucrative business by being the pioneer of sophisticated data-analysis tools.</abstract><title>Seeking an Edge In Data Analysis: [Business/Financial Desk]</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/940820261?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Mar 26, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>940820261</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
