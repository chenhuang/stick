<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; The same lucrative asset driving Sprint Corp. and Nextel Communications Inc. to merge also has the world's biggest technology companies stepping up their lobbying in Washington: spectrum for wireless communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Makers of personal computers, computer chips and other high-tech equipment have been pushing the government to make more spectrum available. Senior executives from Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., among others, have begun regularly calling on federal lawmakers and regulators, in part to discuss spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The computer makers are just the latest players agitating for an overhaul of the nation's spectrum policy. The Bush administration, responding to industry criticism that it has largely ignored technology issues during much of the president's first term, is stepping up efforts to get more radio waves in the hands of commercial entities as they develop and market new technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spectrum comprises invisible radio waves that surround the earth, making wireless communications possible. They are measured, and allotted, in terms of frequencies, and these are finite. Most usable spectrum has been allotted, so the government has to determine who must cede a slice of radio waves to satisfy these new demands. That's largely a matter of deeming one use more essential than another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Spectrum policy, like technology, must stay on the cutting edge," Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell said in a recent speech. "We must be willing to get away from the old models and explore new ones to match the dynamic demands of this industry." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big high-tech companies have identified the spectrum issue as a key to their own growth amid a continuing malaise in the industry. They expect demand for new gadgets and computer-related hardware to rise as high-speed wireless Internet connections become increasingly prevalent. As computer users seek greater mobility -- more of the "hot spots" that enable them to link to the Web wirelessly -- and cellphone users tap the Internet for voice communications, Microsoft, Intel and others see ways to feed the demand. But it won't happen without more spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The next five to 10 years in the high-tech industry, new products will be built around radio waves," said Sean Maloney, who, as executive vice president of Intel's communications group, has been meeting on the issue with FCC members and lawmakers. "The U.S. economy needs more . . . [spectrum] allocated to Internet and broadband wireless." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just this month, President Bush issued an executive order directing federal agencies to review their spectrum needs and to look for more efficient ways to use spectrum. The recommendations are due in December 2005. Such steps are overdue, industry analysts and academics say. They say the way spectrum has been doled out in the past -- letting recipients hold on to their slice indefinitely -- has left large portions of spectrum underused amid surging demand from the commercial sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, though, entrenched lobbies are fighting hard to keep what they have. Broadcasters, for example, don't want to return older spectrum as part of their conversion to transmitting television shows digitally. (Digital broadcasts, because of the way signals can be compressed, require less spectrum than analog ones.) As a result, the date for what has become known as the "digital television conversion" continues to recede further into the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcasters are currently slated to return their old spectrum for reassignment to wireless and public-safety uses by Dec. 31, 2006, but FCC and industry officials now expect that to slide again. The FCC plans to take up the issue again early next year and Mr. Powell has said that he prefers instituting a hard date where the transition will be required, even if it requires congressional action to ensure it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Pentagon, which has been a big holder of spectrum for various military uses including the Global Positioning System satellites, is being pushed to economize how it uses its allotted radio waves and give up what isn't essential. Congress recently established a "spectrum reallocation fund" that would use money obtained from spectrum auctions to reimburse the Pentagon and other federal agencies that give up some of the assets for commercial use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC also continues to auction off blocks of spectrum for commercial use. Hundreds of licenses are being auctioned off in January, although most of that amounts to a resale of what was purchased by now-bankrupt NextWave Telecom Inc. in the mid-1990s but never used. Nextel had been expected to bid for some of these, industry officials said, though a deal with Sprint could change that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With high-tech equipment makers like Cisco and Intel still recovering from the bust of the late 1990s, they see the emerging popularity of wireless communications as an opportunity to drum up new business. Other than phone calls, wireless Internet connections remain much slower than their wired brethren and take too long to transfer &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; files. But as more spectrum -- paired with technologies that use spectrum more efficiently -- becomes available, the increased speed is expected to unleash market demand for new gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laptops will all come with internal "cards" that allow users to sit in a cafe or at the beach and tap into the Internet through a wireless connection. So-called hot spots that offer wireless Internet already are popping up at airports and Starbucks stores around the country, and expectations are that long-distance broadband services that allow consumers to roam -- much the way cellphone companies do now -- also are likely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, for example, could become a leading provider of phone service immediately if it includes software to make calls over the Internet in its next version of Windows. So far, the software giant has stayed mum about what will be included in its new operating system. A Microsoft spokesman didn't return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such services would be heavily reliant on high-speed Internet connections, including wireless, industry officials say. That in turn would require new computer chips, which Intel is developing, and related gadgetry, including phone handsets that run on Internet protocol like the ones Cisco makes for wired and wireless services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed Sprint-Nextel combination would create a spectrum juggernaut. Sprint built its entire wireless network from scratch, spending some $4 billion in government auctions during the 1990s, a company spokesman said. But it needs more users of its wireless network, which Nextel would provide. Meanwhile, Nextel needs better spectrum to offer next-generation wireless services such as surfing the Internet and zapping files from a small hand-held device. A deal with Sprint would provide the spectrum needed as well as better technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The potential for this market to expand quickly is here," said Johannes Bauer, a professor of telecommunications, information studies and media at Michigan State University. For companies offering new wireless services, competition is keeping up the pressure, he said, making the need for spectrum "a way to protect against revenue erosion." &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Squeo, Anne Marie</author><abstract>"The next five to 10 years in the high-tech industry, new products will be built around radio waves," said Sean Maloney, who, as executive vice president of Intel's communications group, has been meeting on the issue with FCC members and lawmakers.
