<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Asian markets edged forward Tuesday ahead of Australia's central bank meeting today and Chinese economic data later in the week, while Standard Chartered slumped 7% after it was accused by the U.S. regulator of dealings with Iran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was some mild support from Europe after German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed support for the European Central Bank's bond buying plan, though Asian stocks lacked strong momentum, as investors looked ahead to central bank meetings and Chinese economic data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall risk aversion has lessened, as illustrated by appetite for stocks globally," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equities at SMBC Nikko Securities in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are already anticipating the next &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; point to come out from the region, as China is scheduled to start releasing economic data for July later in the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Nikkei Average opened slightly lower, but managed to climb into positive territory, up 0.7%, as utilities and commodity stocks rallied. The Japanese index was struggling against a persistently strong local currency, after the dollar lost 0.3% against the yen overnight, making exports more expensive to overseas buyers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A computer system failure prompted the Tokyo Stock Exchange to earlier suspend the trading of all derivatives instruments--including Topix-linked futures and long-term government bond futures. Trading resumed later and analysts said it didn't have an impact on the cash stock market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Australia, investors were looking ahead to the results of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting, out later in the session. Although economists widely expect interest rates will be left untouched, some believe that the central bank could make a statement that is positive for equities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With industrial metals rising overnight, Australian mining companies helped the resource-heavy S&amp;amp;P ASX 200 post a 0.4% gain. BHP Billiton gained 0.7% and Fortescue Metals Group advanced 1.9%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.3%, reclaiming the 20,000 point mark with retail stocks leading the gains. The Shanghai Composite however, was flat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In company news, Standard Chartered skidded 7.4% in Hong Kong, following steep declines in the bank's London-listed shares, on news that New York's financial regulator accused a unit of the bank of scheming with the Iranian government to hide more than $250 billion of illegal transactions for more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in Hong Kong, Prada gained 4.5% after the luxury goods company announced that its first half sales jumped 37% on year to [euro]1.6 billion ($1.98 billion), boosted by strong demand in the Asia-Pacific reason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Taiwan, phone maker HTC dropped by the 7% daily limit after posting a 51% on-year decline in July revenue. The troubled electronics company is now down 51.6% year-to-date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nippon Telegraph &amp;amp; Telephone rose 1.2% in Tokyo, after the company announced that it expects its group net profit to be Â¥575 billion ($7.35 billion) for the year ending March, much in line with expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Australia, construction company Leighton Holdings dropped 1.7% after its first-half results showed its gearing has exceeded the target range, while net profit came in at the lower end of its guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Daniel Inman at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Daniel Inman &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Inman, Daniel</author><abstract></abstract><title>Asian Shares Edge Higher</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1031233378?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Aug 7, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1031233378</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
