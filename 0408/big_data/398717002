<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; San Francisco -- In 1993, the year the Internet opened up to commercial use, a new breed of entrepreneurs began to emerge. Among them was Brewster Kahle, who a few years earlier had been looking at ways to exchange data across computer networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Putting such knowledge to work in business seemed like a natural to him. Trying to attract investors, however, wasn't easy. Back in those days, Mr. Kahle says, "You had to start every meeting with a lesson in `What is the Internet?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though little known outside the high-tech world, Mr. Kahle has done well. In 1995 he sold his Wide Area Information Servers Inc., which pioneered online publishing and searching on the Web, to America Online Inc. for $15 million in stock. And last month, Mr. Kahle made a big splash by nabbing a small company's equivalent of a brass ring for his San Francisco-based Alexa Internet by selling it to hot online retailer Amazon.com Inc. of Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amazon paid stock valued at more than $250 million for the 50-person Internet-navigation company, which for two years has been studying the ways people troll the Internet for information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By interpreting that data, Alexa is trying to help people find the best paths through the sometimes forbidding World Wide Web. And, as the Internet becomes more commercial, it's likely that such information will become increasingly useful to businesses trying to track consumer behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle, who has a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, started out designing supercomputers. But he later became more interested in figuring out ways to make sense of the vast and often-confused stores of information on the Internet. Mr. Kahle used some of his AOL windfall to fund Alexa and also a nonprofit service that archives the Internet to preserve copies of Web pages for both research and posterity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal asked Mr. Kahle, who at 38 years old qualifies as a seasoned player in the Internet game, to reflect on the changing nature of the Internet -- and how it in turn has changed us. The interview was conducted at his home on the old Presidio Army base, which has a killer view of the Golden Gate Bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal: Why don't you give us a little history lesson on the way you got to the Internet? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: The real commercial players just didn't even exist less than a decade ago. I was in one of those technology companies called Thinking Machines [a Cambridge, Mass., designer of supercomputers], and we built a big, fast computer. And the question for us was: How do you make that useful to millions? The only way we could think of is to be able to exchange data over these computer networks, which didn't quite exist yet [in their current form]. So we tried to find an application that real, honest-to-God people would want to use. And it was this finding information across networks that worked. We figured that out in 1989 and built the first electronic publishing system, called WAIS Inc. -- Wide Area Information Servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: How did you start WAIS itself? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: It was a project between Apple Computer, Thinking Machines, KPMG Peat Marwick, and Dow Jones [publisher of this newspaper]. At first, it was a research project to figure out: Are we there yet? There'd been 20 years of hype about the future all being electronic, and desktop publishing had not really delivered much. All that had happened really was that you published to your printer that was next to your desk -- not much of a stretch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd always been interested in &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; and how do you make those things accessible to the masses. When you had a big computer, it was sort of like having a Ferrari that nobody knew how to drive. So we had the computing, but we had no mechanism of making it useful to people. We needed the networks. So I went out to try to pioneer how could we make these networks useful for finding information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: What did it take to do that? You were just a small business at the time, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Yes, very small. There was an initial research phase, and then we started a small business. But getting venture-capital funding in the Internet in 1992 was impossible. Up until 1994, you had to start every meeting with a lesson in what is the Internet. So, there was this steady stream of people just trying to understand what is this Internet. Needless to say, we didn't get any external funding, but we did get a couple of contracts from companies that had used the freeware version and liked it. So we had given away software, because we knew that that was the mechanism that caused revolutions. And that made a need for commercial versions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incredibly, Ross Perot was the first paying user, since we were helping to do the information system for the Perot presidential campaign. They had around 50 offices, one for every state, which they had to hook up. So we built this information system in about seven days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: On the Internet? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Using Internet technology, also dial-up, all sorts of things to try to hook these offices together. And within three weeks, the guy pulled out of the race. So, we did some stuff for his technology company [Perot Systems Corp., Dallas], making his company's huge databases around the world accessible to everybody [in Perot Systems] for almost nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Perot, they're used to having these large mainframe-computer farms. And they looked underneath the desk, and there's this one computer we put in that was about one foot square that served their whole company, with more databases than their mainframes had. And you'd get these guys walking around in white shirts and ties looking at the machines we put in kind of wondering what the future was going to look like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was our first contract, and then we started selling software and putting publishers online. The first were Dow Jones, the New York Times and then Encyclopaedia Britannica. We were intent on building an infrastructure that anchored them to a model based on an open environment [a nonproprietary system accessible to anyone on the Internet]. The key thing -- the mantra of all of us who were involved at the time -- was to have an open system, and if we didn't have an open system then we'd only be building another Lexis-Nexis or another CompuServe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: So what kind of business did you do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: The first year, we had $400,000 in revenue and were very profitable. The second year was $1.2 million and even more profitable. In the third year, we had to basically decrease our profit because the taxes would have hurt so much. So, we had to spend at the end of the year, because if you're a bootstrap, taxes can put you out of business. But you have to be profitable because you have to fund your growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Do you find it ironic that you were one of the first Internet companies and you were profitable, since none seem to be today? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Oh yeah, we were very profitable; we had to be. And so we tripled in size every year until America Online bought us. We were trying to prove that there was room for commercial entities on the Internet. I would be at conferences and I'd raise my hand and say, "I'm the token `dot.com' here. I'm here to try to show that you can make money by publishing on the Net." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: And what was the reaction of people? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: "You're crazy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Because? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Most people couldn't see beyond just e-mail and file transfer. The idea of accessing databases around the world as easily as you access your hard drive hadn't really sunk in to very many people. But there was a small cadre who saw it, I think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Who would you say did see it coming? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Tim Berners Lee [creator of the World Wide Web] was absolutely critical. He carried the flag of open systems, and the Internet would be dramatically different without Tim Berners Lee. It could have all become a closed environment, like a Lexis-Nexis or what the Microsoft Network was originally designed to be, what AOL is traditionally, which is a closed environment. And Tim Berners Lee carried the open systems flag like a British statesman. The Web wouldn't be the same without him. Here's a man who could have become a fabulously rich multimillionaire. I tried to hire him and he said, "No, it's time to build standards committees to be able to support the industry." I respect him intensely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Who else? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Vint Cerf invented many of the original protocols, and there were many participants in that. But his real participation was carrying the ball in organization structures to try to help the Internet grow by a millionfold and not collapse of its own weight. It requires not just technical skill, but how do you navigate groups of people, government infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Why did you choose to sell to AOL in 1995 if you were so committed to the medium? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: The mission of WAIS was to try to help electronic publishers make money by publishing on the Internet. And by demonstrating the ad model/subscription model that we did with several different publishers, largely that mission had been done. AOL had an ability to compensate publishers because they had a royalties stream. So that made sense to us to try to hook the publishers up for the royalty stream based on the user population. So that's why we thought it made sense to sell to AOL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly, though, AOL wanted to build AOL II, which was an Internet-based [nonproprietary] AOL, and they bought a bunch of companies to be able to build that. BookLink, which was a browser. They bought Redgate, which was an Internet design and marketing company. They bought an Internet-service provider. They bought WebCrawler, a directory [of Internet sites]. They bought ANS, which was a backbone [or network-hardware] provider. They had it all. They had enough to be the Internet -- not just a player on the Internet, but the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, shortly after we were purchased, AOL found that its existing business was still going gangbusters. And they had a hard enough time keeping up with the growth of just being a player on the Internet, as opposed to dominating it. So the company instead gave its user base simply an ability to browse the Internet, because it had everything it could do to expand fast enough to absorb that growing market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Did you regret the sale? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: It's difficult when you're running a small company and you sort of live and breathe it and your ego is wrapped around it. But if you have a company that's making $4 million a year, and even when you grow it to be $12 million the next year, it's very difficult to argue when somebody says, "That's a rounding error. You're much more important toward making a billion-dollar company, so why don't you help the mother ship?" And even though it's difficult to hear that as a small-business man, they're absolutely right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: After you finished with WAIS, what did you want to do with this money from AOL? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: I felt I needed to build some more of the Internet infrastructure. My career is built around the Internet and trying to make the Internet work. And when, in 1996, I looked around, I found it still looked kind of hokey. It was unreliable, people couldn't find what they wanted, and it didn't handle very well. We started to get search engines to be able to find some information, but even the search engines were running out of gas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ability to find the right 10 documents out of a hundred million using two keywords is not a technical task -- that's lunacy. You need more information to find the good stuff. One solution, if you're a provider of Internet directories, is to limit your collection. Otherwise, if you're the one who's searching, you need better information about what it is you're looking for. That was the kind of problem that I set out to try to solve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I started another company, and I have to say it's wonderful to have enough money to start a company without having to bootstrap -- that you can actually start with some cash and put in some infrastructure and hire some managers. I spent $400,000 of my own money, which allowed us to get the core team together and start archiving the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we raised another $900,000 to start Alexa -- which is short for the Library of Alexandria. It was the last place a group of people tried to collect all knowledge in one place and tried to organize it. But after 2,000 years, it became too big a collection to be able to do that with, because of the size of the paper and physical objects. But now with electronics you can actually collect it all in one place and organize it, and that's what we set out to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The really powerful idea was to use the users of the Internet to make it meaningful. I have always thought that the hidden resource of the Internet is not the content on the Internet, but the users of the Internet. So the real question to ask is not what does some editor tell me to do, but: Where did other people go that were on this Web page that I'm looking at? Where else did they go in such a way that they had a good time? It is just a matter of following the paths and leveraging all the readers of the Internet. It's remarkable what average people come up with on their own with a little help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: What could stop that kind of widespread use of the Internet? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Well, the most surprising aspect of the Internet is the widespread public adoption of technology that is this bad. Modems are slow, the sites are unorganized. So it is remarkable to me that there's been this much interest that has caused a lot of people to put down the television remote and put away the processed world that we lived in to go into this creaking, barely working Internet space and start playing around and building it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We don't have couch potatoes out there. We can prove it. We know where people surf. They're not just doing weather, news, sports and the Simpsons. People are out there doing their own thing in their own way. And that starts to flip the equation of power -- where you need to actually become good to succeed and it's a meritocracy out there. You actually have to be useful to win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: What are the best elements of the Internet for you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Well, today there is so much momentum in the Internet, there are so many people who are excited, and everybody's talking about the Internet bubble -- "Why are these valuations so high?" And yes, there's a lot of speculation, but it's also pretty cool that people are just so excited. And why not? Here is an opportunity for people to participate in the revolution -- they were locked out of it with cable, they were locked out of it with television. Radio was made up of very few publishers, and mostly people had to just listen. But the Internet turned the equation on its head and made everyone into a publisher. There are 20 million different publishers out there on the Internet. Can you imagine that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: But is that going to continue, especially with all this consolidation lately? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Oh, I doubt this growth can be stopped, but there is always a danger. A bad set of laws or a stock crash could cause dramatic changes to what it is we are experiencing now -- or if some sort of misdirected company can monopolize, and they will try, because being a monopoly is such a lucrative position to be in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that could happen, because of the bottlenecks. You have plumbing bottlenecks of getting into people's homes. There are the backbones. There are particular protocols and router [network-switch] companies that sort of stay at the plumbing level. There are content aggregators that have a tremendous influence. And with the run-up in the stock market, these companies have fantastic storehouses of wealth to be able to buy other companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Do you worry about a downturn in terms of the stock market and what it'll do to the Internet market? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: It's got to happen. All the economists say that it's going to take a downturn. Do I worry about it? No, I don't stay up at night. The real thing to focus on is that people are excited. There's a revolution going on. When we were running WAIS, to educate people about our product, we had to have several meetings, they would have to fly to San Francisco, they'd come into our office and we could only handle so many a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd send out these physical pamphlets and brochures, and we'd put out 50 to 100 a week. We were a small company of 10 or 15 people and we were serving an international base. That all changed, where we were starting to ship software electronically, that we had a Web site, people could come and learn about the company so you didn't have those 20 minutes of who are you, then they stopped coming at all and they just bought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's much, much more efficient. Running a business with Internet technology is phenomenally more efficient than it was before, even if you were an Internet company in 1993. So I believe there's really an underlying boon to productivity, and the Internet is going to just take over more and more and more inefficient subfields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: But does that work if you are a small player? What do you have to have, from your perspective, to do well at this moment in time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: Funding. You have to be fueled in large part by funding. So you either have to be important to the company that you work for, as your company starts to move toward being an Internet company, or you've got to have some new idea that someone wants to fund. Because there's such amazing wealth now, paper wealth at least based on the stock market, people are investing in these companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And once you get that money, you have to grow or die. Or you could find a niche. Develop a loyal clientele. Unfortunately, though, because of the Internet, if you're selling something unusual, you could also be competing with somebody who's thousands of miles away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WSJ: Does the idea of that worry you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Kahle: No, no. To me, this kind of competition is great. It would be more horrible if the Internet reached stasis, if people said that really the World Wide Web is the best thing going and that's what it is. Dah dah, we're done. That would be a crime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ms. Swisher is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's San Francisco bureau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1993 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's News -- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business and Finance &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Clinton's budget package, emphasizing deficit reduction, squeaks through Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interest rates drop to levels unseen in 25 years, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling as low as 6.74%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bell Atlantic announces plans to acquire cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. in a deal seen as defining a new interactive age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ford says it will send three senior executives to Japan to help rescue Mazda, in which it owns a 25% stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the economy sluggish, blue-chip companies cut prices of many products, from Pampers diapers to Marlboro cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starbucks goes public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's News -- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; World-Wide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Maastricht Treaty goes into effect, paving the way for European economic and monetary union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Israel and the PLO exchange letters of recognition and sign an agreement on Palestinian autonomy in Israeli-occupied territories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A terrorist bomb explodes in New York City's World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flooding in the Midwest leaves at least 50 people dead, more than 70,000 homeless, and causes $12 billion in property damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Clinton puts forward a universal-health-insurance proposal devised mainly by a task force headed by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Academy Award for Best Picture: "Schindler's List" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Box-Office Leaders (in millions)* &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grammy Awards &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Record of the year: "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Album of the year: "The Bodyguard - Original Soundtrack Album" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Various Artists &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Song of the year: "A Whole New World (Aladdin's Theme)" by Alan Menkin and Tim Rice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leading TV Shows (average percentage of TV households tuned in, 1993-94 TV season) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best-selling Books (hardcover copies sold in 1993) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fiction: "The Bridges of Madison County" by Robert James Waller 4,362,352 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonfiction: "See, I Told You So" by Rush Limbaugh 2,587,600 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Total box-office revenue to the present in U.S. and Canada; does not include home video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources: Nielsen Media Research; National Association of Theatre Owners; Publishers Weekly; The Wall Street Journal Almanac; The World Almanac &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By Kara Swisher</author><abstract>Though little known outside the high-tech world, Mr.  (Brewster) Kahle has done well.
