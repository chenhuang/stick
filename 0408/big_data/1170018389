<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; A pair of local upstarts looking to tackle different facets of the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; problem collected early-stage funding from investors last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies have access to more information than ever before. The ubiquity of the Internet and rise of cloud computing means all of that information - dubbed "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" - can be stored and processed more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The challenge for companies, though, is analyzing it in a way that allows them to operate their business more efficiently and effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter firms such as Zoomdata and Always Prepped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoomdata allows executives to view their data on mobile devices in the form of easy-to-understand charts, graphics and illustrations. Zoomdata, which spun off from parent company Augaroo in September, raised $1.1 million last week from 10 local angel investors and institutions, founder Justin Langseth said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our goal is to bring the power of &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; analytics to the non-technical business user, and to turn real-time data streams into tactile, three-dimensional data art," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Reston-based company has 12 employees, but Langseth expects to add more as the firm ramps up development of the product and prepares to sell it to more customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We realized we needed more engineers and more customer-facing people to properly go after this huge opportunity," Langseth said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rockville-based Always Prepped wants to handle data in classrooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The young firm raised $650,000 from angel investors to create a Web site that aggregates information from different databases where teachers keep record of students' attendance and academic performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always Prepped got its start as a place for students to practice math problems online, but founder Fahad Hassan said educators already had a plethora of online teaching tools. Nine months ago the company switched to building a dashboard where teachers could see all of their information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Data is everywhere. It exists. We're just pulling it into one place and our goal is to make it consumable for teachers," Hassan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True Ventures, a venture capital firm with offices in San Francisco and Great Falls, led the round. Hooman Radfar, the chairman and former chief executive of McLean-based AddThis, also participated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; overlys@washpost.com &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>Overly, Steven</author><abstract>The young firm raised $650,000 from angel investors to create a Web site that aggregates information from different databases where teachers keep record of students' attendance and academic performance.</abstract><title>Two big data firms win investments to get off the ground</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1170018389?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Nov 19, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1170018389</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
