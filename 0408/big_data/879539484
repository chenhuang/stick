<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; New orders for cars, industrial machines and other manufactured goods fell in June, a signal that the nation's factories--and the broader economy--are trudging into the second half of the year with flagging momentum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orders for durable goods, defined as wares designed to last more than three years, fell 2.1% in June while growth in the earlier month was revised down, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The decline was driven largely by the volatile aircraft category but the report also showed weakness in an important measure of business investment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft--a gauge of business capital spending plans--fell 0.4% over the month, including a decrease in machinery and computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decline came despite government tax credits designed to stoke business investment by giving companies a tax break on capital purchases made by the end of the year, though many economists expect that spending will ramp up in the second half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not seeing any great pop in orders for capital equipment that you might have expected, given the depreciation allowance," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at research firm MFR Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The durable-goods reading is the last &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; point before Friday's release of the government's tally of second-quarter gross domestic product--the broadest measure of economic activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday's weak showing--new durable-goods orders have fallen twice in the past three months--was just the latest among a host of disappointing economic data that has prompted economists to steadily downgrade their second-quarter forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many did so again Wednesday. St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers said weak durable goods orders and a slower pace of inventory building - inventories are a plus for GDP - prompted the firm to shave one-tenth of a percentage point from its second quarter forecast, to a weak 1.3% annual growth rate. Michael Montgomery, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said his firm's forecast was shaved to 1.3% from 1.6% growth, based largely on the slower rate of inventory building. Inventories increased 0.4% in June, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2009 - when the U.S. economy was still in recession. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the Federal Reserve's beige book report, also out Wednesday, noted that while the economy continues to grow the pace has slowed considerably over the past several months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report, a summary of economic conditions across the central bank's 12 regional districts, said eight districts reported a slowdown in growth. Like the durable goods report, the beige book suggested the factory sector is steadying and even slowing in some districts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer spending has continued to grow, the Fed said, in part because of lower gasoline prices. However, consumers remain vigilant about finding deals and while some retailers have been able to pass through price increases, many have seen profits squeezed by higher costs for raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hiring is also weak. "Although most Federal Reserve Districts observed modest hiring increases, labor market conditions remained soft," the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Conor Dougherty at  conor.dougherty@wsj.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Conor Dougherty &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Dougherty, Conor</author><abstract>St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers said weak durable goods orders and a slower pace of inventory building - inventories are a plus for GDP - prompted the firm to shave one-tenth of a percentage point from its second quarter forecast, to a weak 1.3% annual growth rate.</abstract><title>Durable-Goods Orders Fall</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/879539484?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jul 27, 2011</pub_date><pq_doc_id>879539484</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
