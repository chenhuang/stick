<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Industrial Internet Will &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; End Downtime, GE Hopes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In General Electric Co.'s vision of the future, the company will be able to fix or replace its products before they break. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In that world, airlines will receive notices from GE many miles before a jet-engine part is likely to fail, railroads will be able to avoid derailments, appliance-repair people will be able to diagnose problems remotely, and hospitals will be better able to allocate sparse resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That future hinges on the ability of those devices to send status updates from sophisticated sensors over a network that connects people to machines and machines to one another, in much the same way people are connected over the Web. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While this technology's potential has been discussed for years, there are signs it is gaining traction. The Internet of Things, or the industrial Internet, as GE calls it, has the potential to add between $10 trillion and $15 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030, according to a report issued by the company Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says a 1% increase in efficiency generated thanks to the network could mean savings of $30 billion in aviation, $66 billion in power generation and $63 billion in health care over 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such research shows some people have finally figured out what to do with the mass of data that &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt; and the Internet of Things are making available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ability in our world to go man to machine, the ability to marry real-time customer data with real-time performance data of our products -- to me that's the holy grail in our business," GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said at Salesforce.com's Dreamforce conference in September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already, sensors on trains are transmitting information back to rail companies, and real-time diagnostics and predictive analytics software are preventing machine breakdowns before they happen. Union Pacific Corp., the nation's largest railroad company, can now predict certain kinds of derailments days or weeks before they are likely to occur. Its software analyzes data from acoustic and visual sensors on the underside of each rail car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While those sensors have been in place for a decade, they have only been able to help technicians spot imminent problems. Now, with predictive analytics, the company can spot dangerous conditions well in advance of a problem, Union Pacific Chief Information Officer Lynden Tennison told CIO Journal in March. Major derailments can result in $20 million to $40 million in damages and significant delays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE is busily selling data services of this kind to its customers. Vince Campisi, CIO of GE's Intelligent Platforms division, told CIO Journal, "we have a heritage and domain history to make us able to more effectively leverage that [industrial Internet] technology, and now that comes in packages that customers can buy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company estimates that 2.5% of rail operations costs -- about $5.6 billion a year globally -- are the result of system inefficiencies, whether it's a derailment or waste in fleet scheduling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GE report also devotes considerable attention to how the industrial Internet will affect energy firms. Yet, it fails to discuss at any great length the security implications of creating a network linking all these machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest threat is that connecting these systems using standard communication technologies makes it more likely that they can be attacked successfully. Chevron Corp., Saudi Aramco, Rasgas and other companies have been hit by cyberattacks in recent years, but have been able to largely contain any damages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the possibility of creating efficiencies and saving money will be enticing to many executives. Last year Air Canada signed an agreement with GE Aviation to use its myEngines digital app suite that helps companies manage their engine fleets and improve productivity. Air Canada operates a fleet of GE engines in its aircraft. Engine maintenance alone cost the airline industry $25 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With an industrial Internet tracking engine parts and communicating back to its manufacturer, GE figures that airlines will reduce commercial jet-engine- maintenance costs by $250 million for every 1% improvement in engine-maintenance efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a vision that CIOs can buy into today -- or a flavor of Kool-Aid they can willingly drink -- depending on your perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Rachael King &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subscribe to WSJ: &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Anonymous</author><abstract>"The ability in our world to go man to machine, the ability to marry real-time customer data with real-time performance data of our products -- to me that's the holy grail in our business," GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said at Salesforce.com's Dreamforce conference in September.</abstract><title>Business Technology: CIO Journal</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1220554194?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Nov 29, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1220554194</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
