<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp.'s profit rose 35%, largely due to sales of the latest version of its Windows operating system, as corporate technology buyers began to join consumers in demand for personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results are further evidence that the PC industry is continuing to rebound after one of its worst slumps in history. Initial demand for Windows 7 -- the operating system released in October that was much better received than predecessor Windows Vista -- was mainly fueled by consumers. But Microsoft suggested Thursday that business customers are also starting to retire machines running older versions of Windows in favor of new models with Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, Microsoft said revenue from its Windows division rose 28% from a year earlier to $4.42 billion. It estimated that more than 10% of all PCs world-wide are running the software already, making it the fastest-selling operating system in the company's history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Klein, Microsoft's finance chief, said in an interview Windows 7 is a "phenomenal story both on the consumer side and now a little on the business side." He said the company sees a "lot of deployment coming" of Windows 7 PCs among business customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, shares of Microsoft fell more than 4% in after-hours trading, in a sign that some investors were hoping for even stronger signs of a rebound in Microsoft's business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft reported total profit for the quarter of $4.01 billion, or 45 cents a share, up from $2.98 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $14.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's results included the deferral of $305 million in revenue related to a program that allows customers who purchased Microsoft's Office suite to upgrade for free to a new version later this spring. Without that deferral, Microsoft said revenue would have been $14.81 billion, or an 8% increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's most encouraging is they see business PCs coming back," said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. Still, Mr. Barnicle said Microsoft's results didn't contain any dramatic signs that the company has managed to harvest growth from newer trends in technology, like Internet search or "cloud computing," in which companies like Amazon.com Inc. host online applications for business customers in &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; centers. Industry watchers view both trends as potential threats to some incumbent technology companies. Microsoft has started to invest heavily in both areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is making a big bet that it can catch up to Google Inc. by heavily marketing Bing, a new version of its Internet search engine that launched last year. Revenue in the online division -- which includes Bing and its MSN Web site -- grew to $566 million from $507 million a year earlier, but the losses from online services swelled to $713 million from $411 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's results demonstrated that there is still life in the traditional computer business, despite high-profile new devices like Apple Inc.'s iPad. Intel Corp., the dominant supplier of chips for personal computers, last week saw its profit nearly quadruple while revenue increased 44%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand in the overall PC market has returned, with a 24% year-over-year increase during the first quarter in global shipments of new machines, according to research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it expects sales to businesses to further improve as it releases a wave of new products in the coming months, including Office 2010 and its SQL database software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a name="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Nick Wingfield &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Wingfield, Nick</author><abstract>Microsoft Corp.'s profit rose 35%, largely due to sales of the latest version of its Windows operating system, as corporate technology buyers began to join consumers in demand for personal computers.</abstract><title>Windows 7 Drives Microsoft Profit</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/89138052?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Apr 23, 2010</pub_date><pq_doc_id>89138052</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
