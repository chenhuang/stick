<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; The FX Global Call covers the main talking points from an 11:00 GMT news meeting involving DJ FX Trader editors in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other FX hot spots when warranted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. The euro hit another 22-month low against the dollar at the start of European trading, but something is holding the currency back from plunging much further into the abyss. HSBC says investors are holding off on making riskier bets on the off chance leaders come up with a policy response that keeps Greece in the euro and prevents other countries from heading down the same path. If a deal is in the works, it's being kept under wraps, as an EU summit wrapped up Wednesday night without any major new measures being announced. Citi, which previously put Greece's exit at up to 75%, put a date on its forecast, predicting the country would leave the euro on Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. Weak economic data isn't making EU leaders' job any easier. Euro-zone business activity contracted at its fastest pace in three years, with preliminary PMI for May coming in at 45.9, from 46.7 in April. Even Germany showed signs of weakness, with a 49.5 reading. U.K. first-quarter GDP was revised lower by 0.1%, for a 0.3% contraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. If the euro's drifting lower, emerging-market currencies are getting slammed. Central banks in Brazil and Mexico intervened to support their currencies on Wednesday, while India's rupee hit another record low against the dollar overnight. In Mexico's case, it was the first use of an emergency dollar liquidity measure since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. The Swiss National Bank may be feeling the consequences of investors' rapid exit from the euro and emerging-market currencies. For weeks, a large bidder, thought to be Rabobank, has defended the Swiss franc's 1.20 to the euro floor with a bid between 1.2010 and 1.2005, New York's Matthew Walter reports. On Wednesday, this bidder bought 7 billion euros, seven times the usual daily amount required to keep the floor intact. The theory in the market is that this is the Swiss central bank acting by proxy, after the franc briefly breached 1.20 last month. But if Wednesday's trade is any indication, this trade is about to get a lot more expensive for the SNB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 5. The real's plunge represents something bigger than a reaction to Europe or slowing growth in China, says Luis Stuhlberger, manager of Verde, Brazil's largest hedge fund. Stuhlberger says Brazil's consumer-driven model for economic growth is running out of gas, and the government isn't doing enough to put forth an alternative. He's pushing for more fiscal and social reforms, including tackling Brazil's pension fund system and cutting taxes and government spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 6. More worrying signs out of China: preliminary PMI slipped last month, breaking a trend where it had been heading back toward 50. Standard &amp;amp; Poor's and Moody's both warned of dangers in the country's property market, with S&amp;amp;P saying small developers may not survive the year. China's interest-rate swap market is pricing in as many as four interest rate cuts over the next year; while this seems extreme, it indicates that investors believe tinkering with banks' reserve requirement ratios won't be enough to shore up growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 7. Two &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; points out of the U.S. coming at 8:30 a.m. EDT today: April durable goods orders are seen dropping 0.3%, while weekly jobless claims are expected to hold steady at 370,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Brian Baskin is assistant managing editor for the Americas at DJ FX Trader, a foreign exchange news service jointly produced by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Brian Baskin &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Baskin, Brian</author><abstract>(Brian Baskin is assistant managing editor for the Americas at DJ FX Trader, a foreign exchange news service jointly produced by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\n</abstract><title>FX GLOBAL CALL: Our Take On The Day's Big FX News</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1015591994?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>May 24, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1015591994</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
