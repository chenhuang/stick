<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Corrections &amp;amp; Amplifications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEVI STRAUSS &amp;amp; Co. is reviewing whether to reassign its $80 million-in-billings jeans advertising account. A headline for Monday's Advertising column incorrectly said the account had been lost by incumbent Foote, Cone &amp;amp; Belding Worldwide. Advertising Age says Foote Cone's U.S. gross income rose 12% to $299.9 million last year; the column incorrectly said those figures applied to the agency's world-wide gross income. (WSJ Oct. 30, 1997) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foote, Cone &amp;amp; Belding landed the $80 million 3Com ad account Friday, a welcome boost for the big ad agency after a string of recent setbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Santa Clara, Calif., modem maker's alliance with an agency best known for jeans and cookie ads is yet another sign that technology advertisers have set their hearts on captivating mainstream consumers, not just nerds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it is a happy event for Foote Cone, whose chairman and chief executive, Brendan Ryan, last week also learned to his chagrin that the prestigious Levi Strauss jeans account was considering switching ad agencies. That shocker came in the wake of two high-profile account losses. Earlier this year, Citicorp unceremoniously dumped Foote Cone for a crosstown rival, Young &amp;amp; Rubicam. And this summer Foote Cone had to resign its monster $240 million Mazda Motor account because of a client conflict arising from the move by parent True North Communications to acquire Bozell Jacobs Kenyon &amp;amp; Eckhardt, which creates ads for Chrysler. Foote Cone also reluctantly said goodbye to two other accounts, Tambrands and Snapple, after they were sold to new owners with ties to other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3Com, the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;-networking company that recently acquired U.S. Robotics, didn't even go through the usual exercise of conducting an official account review before awarding Foote Cone's San Francisco office world-wide responsibility for creating and coordinating all of its advertising. The plum was simply yanked away from a gaggle of agencies and handed to Foote Cone, which has been working on the company's advertising in Asia for the past two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Foote Cone's San Francisco office was grappling with last week's news that its 67-year relationship with Levi Strauss was being reconsidered amid a broader review of operations. Foote Cone's work for Levi has been highly praised. Its work for Levi's Dockers and Slates brands isn't affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foote Cone's voluble leader, Mr. Ryan, vowed early in the week that the agency would keep the jeans account. In an interview Friday, he sounded less sure but still determined. "Every man, woman and child at FCB is going to do everything humanly possible and even superhumanly possible to keep that account," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Levi spends about $80 million a year to advertise its jeans, which are facing increasing competitive pressure. Recent Levi ads created by Foote Cone feature a scruffy young man cruising back roads in a car crammed with stuffed animals, and in another spot, a trendy older gentleman buying condoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, 3Com's vice president of corporate marketing, Jerry Johnstone, was effusive in his praise of the agency, citing Foote Cone's creative prowess on behalf of Levi. He also cited the agency's innovative "intranet" services, which allow client and agency to edit videos and other work around the globe in a flash. But Mr. Johnstone conceded that Levi's decision caught him off guard last week. "I just hope it doesn't distract them because we have a lot to do in a short period of time. . . . "I've been assured it's not going to be" a distraction. 3Com also said it would be working with Foote Cone's sister agency, Modem Media, which specializes in on-line media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foote Cone is better known for winning clients than for losing them. And it has recently picked up new ad duties from Nabisco and Quaker Oats, both existing clients, as well as from Keds, a new account. Net new billings pulled in for the first six months of 1997 were $185 million, Foote Cone says; that figure predates the Mazda and Citicorp news. In April, the agency's San Francisco office was named "Agency of the Year" by Advertising Age. Last year, FCB's world-wide gross income grew 12% to $299.9 million. Ranked fifth in the U.S. among ad agencies, its big clients include Kimberly-Clark, S.C. Johnson &amp;amp; Son and Kraft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any uncertainty at Foote Cone hardly helps True North, although as Prudential Securities analyst James Dougherty puts it, "Anybody who's invested in True North by now should know you're dealing with an unpredictable company." A fight over a now-scuttled European joint venture hurt the stock's price until it was resolved this year. Mr. Dougherty expects True North to report third-quarter earnings of 27 cents share next month, up slightly from 26 cents a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "True North is clearly in a defensive mode right now" with "an ill-defined game plan going forward," says Bill Bird, an analyst with Smith Barney who covers the ad-agency group. He said he couldn't estimate True North's third-quarter earnings because he isn't currently following the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foote Cone's Mr. Ryan sees plenty of opportunities for growth. Foote Cone is considered a shoo-in for Taco Bell's fieldmarketing account, which is estimated to equal between $80 million and $100 million in billings. A decision could come this week. Mr. Ryan said other growth opportunities lie in autos, health care, technology, direct marketing and abroad. Already established in Latin America, Foote Cone has been gobbling up ad agencies in Europe and Asia. "The thing we've been concentrating on for the last two years is fleshing out our network to the point where we can with confidence encourage our clients to give us their business," Mr. Ryan said. The Foote Cone chief noted that he has just returned from a meeting in Indonesia with the executives running the agency's Asian operations. What he saw was a true collaborative spirit, "a totally shared sense of purpose. It was terrific," he said, adding: "It was something that's frankly new for FCB." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ad Notes. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IRIDIUM: The new advertising account of satellite phone-services operator Iridium was handed to Ammirati Puris Lintas. There was no incumbent. Ammirati is owned by Interpublic Group. The agency beat out Cordiant's Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi Advertising and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. Iridium's executive director of marketing and corporate communications John Windolph said the account represents more than $50 million in ad spending but that new ads aren't due out until the second quarter of next year. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By Sally Goll Beatty</author><abstract>LEVI STRAUSS &amp; Co.  is reviewing whether to reassign its $80 million-in-billings jeans advertising account.
