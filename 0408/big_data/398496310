<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; "It's great," says the 47-year-old Mr. Stealey, who uses actual rudder controls at his feet to steer his craft. "I'm 500 meters behind you trying to blow your tail off." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the realm of high-tech entertainment, the CD-ROM and on-line technology have struck a promising marriage, each enhancing the other's potential. Through the Internet and other on-line hookups, CD-ROM users can supplement the information stored on their disks, prolonging the shelf life of their software. For applications that require reams of data, a CD-ROM disk can in seconds provide basic content that could take days to download, such as the audio-visual setting of a game. And users can connect with each other to enrich their disk-based experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Computers have often been accused of isolating people," says Daniel Tynan, a freelance writer who until recently was editor in chief of CD-ROM Today, a magazine based in Brisbane, Calif. But the coupling of CD-ROMs and on-line technology, he says, "gives people a way of interacting with people that is more intense and direct." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The idea of the on-line CD-ROM has already taken root. Some CD-ROM-based magazines offer easy click-on access to Internet Web sites where users can view fresher articles or exchange thoughts with other readers. Owners of CD-ROM movie and record guides can find updated reviews and clips on the Internet. Players of CD-ROM board games such as Monopoly can match wits transcontinentally through Internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for enthusiasts of arcade-like CD-ROM games such as Air Warrior -- including Mr. Stealey, president of Interactive Magic Inc. in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which is co-designing the game's sequel -- playing against live opponents through an on-line hookup beats playing alone against a computer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On-line CD-ROMs face some challenges. Currently, users of some disks, especially data-intensive games like Air Warrior, can link up effectively only if they subscribe to the same commercial on-line service. If they try to connect over the Internet, they can suffer delays in transmission, especially when audio or visual clips are being transmitted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is likely to change with improvements in technology. A "cable modem" hooked up to an on-line connection from your cable-television company or other provider could make it possible to download Internet-based audio-visual content 350 times faster than can a high-end phone modem available today. That would mean game players could connect through any kind of on-line link, including the Internet, with no noticeable transmission lags. A cable modem selling for $400 to $500 could be widely available in about a year, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And advances in CD-ROM technology could both entice more people to take advantage of faster on-line links, and make it easier to do so. Computer versions of new digital videodisks, expected to be available in about a year, will have 14 times the capacity of today's CD-ROMs, enabling designers to cram in ever-better graphics and sound -- a sensory feast for game players. And with CD "recorders," which may be affordable in a few years, users could find an even greater payoff than today in connecting their disks to on-line services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The advent of cheap CD recorders and &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; pipelines would mean that publishers of CD-ROM-based games, for instance, "could put new scenarios on the Net, and they can be downloaded" relatively quickly onto the CD-ROM itself without taking up valuable space on a user's computer hard drive, says Robert Davidson, chief executive officer of Davidson &amp;amp; Associates Inc., a CD-ROM publisher in Torrance, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a look at some entertainment-based CD-ROM products that can take advantage of on-line connections: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Felix the Cat Cartoon Toolbox (Big Top Productions L.P., San Francisco; $35): Users can create their own Felix the Cat cartoons, complete with animation, sound and moving images, and zap them out to a Web site where they can be viewed by others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We download others' cartoons and put on a show," says John Sain, a free-lance graphic artist in Secaucus, N.J. Mr. Sain says he and his eight-year-old stepson, Jan, take special pleasure in editing and manipulating other cartoons, redesigning them to their own taste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any Internet user can download Felix the Cat cartoons from the Web site, but without the CD-ROM it takes 20 minutes. With the CD-ROM, it takes just 30 seconds. That's because the disks contain the basic "skeleton" of audio-visual content on which every cartoon is built. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People want to have TV channels on the Internet," says Jim Myrick, co-founder of Big Top. "We believe we're the first cartoon channel." The company is working on a similar product based on "The Simpsons." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Monopoly (Hasbro Inc., Pawtucket, R.I.; $40): You can play against the computer and, if you have Internet access, visit the Monopoly Web site and arrange a game with other budding real-estate tycoons. Based on the classic board game, the CD-ROM version adds a lot of "visual candy," says Gary Carlin, a Hasbro marketing executive. With the help of pictures, "you get to see what Boardwalk really looks like." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another feature: automatic currency conversions. If you play against users in France, for instance, your dollar-based transactions are automatically converted into francs, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CD-ROM, introduced last November, is a hit. Hasbro sold out its first run of 200,000 disks in just two months. The company is now considering introducing CD-ROM versions of other games this fall, including Scrabble, Clue, Battleship and Risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Board games "are really about interaction and connecting people," Mr. Carlin says. "The Internet is an extension of that. The table is now the virtual world." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Music Central (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.; $34.95): With a discography of 70,000 albums, hundreds of reviews, biographical sketches of artists and essays on music, this CD-ROM is a treasure trove for music lovers. To keep the CD-ROM current, Microsoft provides click-on access to its Web site, where more-recent reviews are posted and can be downloaded via instructions on the CD-ROM. Updates are free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Blockbuster Video Guide (Blockbuster Entertainment Group, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Creative Multimedia Corp., Portland, Ore.; $19.99): This CD-ROM contains almost anything a film buff would need: hundreds of movie reviews, video clips, photographs, biographies and trivia. For updates, the user needn't even have Internet access. By clicking on an "Update" icon, it's possible to download 50 to 100 new reviews each month through a direct phone connection to a separate computer. Each download takes about two minutes, costs $3 and is paid for with a credit card. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everything is categorized and cross-referenced," says Michelle McNeil, a product manager at Creative Multimedia. For instance, while reading about Robert DeNiro's role in the movie "Heat," a user can quickly pull down a list of other movies in which the actor has appeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has sold about one million copies of the CD-ROM since introducing it last July. But it has competition: Microsoft's Cinemania CD-ROM is chock full of similar movie information -- and the Internet updates are free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Trouble &amp;amp; Attitude (Marinex Multimedia Corp., New York; $9.95 an issue): "A multimedia men's magazine modeled after Esquire," is how Marinex's co-president, Jonathan Braun, describes this CD-ROM product. Packaged like a regular magazine, it is published quarterly and sold on newsstands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marinex originally set up a Web site to promote Trouble &amp;amp; Attitude, "but now we think the two will link up," Mr. Braun says. For instance, one section in the CD-ROM, called Decibels, contains information about new recordings, including 15-second song samples. Later this year, users will be able to pull down newer samples from the Web site, Marinex says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Launch (2Way Media Inc., Santa Monica, Calif.; $8.99 per issue): A CD-ROM magazine published six times a year, Launch is similar in content to Trouble &amp;amp; Attitude. Updated information for its 2,000 subscribers and 150,000 newsstand customers is stored at a Launch Web site. For example, the January issue contained an interview with and song by the rock group Smashing Pumpkins. New tour dates, announced after the CD-ROM was released, can be retrieved over the Internet by clicking on an update button. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Goldberg, 2Way's chief executive, says that just as an on-line connection keeps the CD-ROM fresh, the CD-ROM complements on-line technology: "You can't entertain a user at a Web site because it's too static. You need the power of the CD-ROM and computer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Air Warrior II (Interactive Magic Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C., and Kesmai Corp., Charlottesville, Va.; $10): The current version, Air Warrior I, requires complex DOS commands and has clunky graphics. A better Windows version will be out in the summer -- and will be made available to customers of America Online and other commercial services. Currently, groups of as many as 100 people can play Air Warrior through the GEnie on-line network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -- Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness (Davidson &amp;amp; Associates Inc., Torrance, Calif.; $50): This Tolkienesque fantasy game can be played solo, and as many as eight far-flung players can hook up through Internet accounts. Players can chat privately and create alliances. About 30% of Warcraft fans play over the Internet, says Pat Wyatt, a vice president at Davidson's game division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Naik is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every Thursday night at 10 p.m., J.W. "Wild Bill" Stealey straps himself into the cockpit of a World War II Spitfire fighter and flies wing to wing with other members of his squadron, the Carrier Pigs. The mission: to shoot down enemy aircraft and return safely to base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Stealey, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, plays the CD-ROM game Air Warrior. But instead of confining himself to a solitary pursuit on his personal computer, he links up on the GEnie on-line network to join dozens of other players in aerial dogfights. They can choose from various "theaters" of war, track enemy planes with a computer-based "radar" system, and type in backslaps and thumbs-up messages in live exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Naik, Gautam</author><abstract>The idea of the on-line CD-ROM has already taken root.
