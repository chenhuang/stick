<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Author: Ben Worthen &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of server systems jumped 15% in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner, a sign that large technology companies and other businesses are again spending big on tech projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of the growth was fueled by new and expanding data centers, says Jeffrey Hewitt, an analyst at Gartner. In many cases, it is tech companies that sell software or host data online that are making these pushes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The kinds of servers that are used in the greatest numbers in these giant computer rooms--and which saw the biggest sales gains during the quarter--are those based on the x86 chip technology popularized by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Skinless" varieties that come with some parts and casings stripped away were among the biggest gainers, Mr. Hewitt says. These servers "cut down on the cost" of running a &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; center, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard Co., the largest server maker, saw revenue from those machines increase 22.5% in the quarter. Dell Inc., No. 3 in the sector, experienced even faster growth, with revenue rising 25.6% from the year-earlier period. International Business Machines Corp., the No. 2 supplier, posted a 9.9% increase, while No. 4 Fujitsu's revenue grew 5.2%. Newcomer Oracle Corp. experienced a 2.6% decline in server revenue; the software company joined the market in January by buying Sun Microsystems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shipments of x86 servers grew 14.9% in the quarter, but revenue for the boxes grew 29.5%. That's because buyers are increasingly doing more with these servers--often using a technology called virtualization that requires more computing capacity--and as a result are choosing more expensive hardware, says Mr. Hewitt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Increased spending on servers is typically good news for the entire tech industry, as sales of server systems often precede spending on other items, such as storage systems and software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Ben Worthen at ben.worthen@wsj.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Ben Worthen &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author></author><abstract>The kinds of servers that are used in the greatest numbers in these giant computer rooms--and which saw the biggest sales gains during the quarter--are those based on the x86 chip technology popularized by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
