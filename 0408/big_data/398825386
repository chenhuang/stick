<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt;   FED UP WITH the hassle of retrieving old-fashioned X-rays stored in a warehouse 30 miles outside Houston, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center decided to jump aboard the digital bandwagon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Many hospitals make the same decision only to regret it. Often, they invest in big-ticket digital-imaging communications equipment in their radiology departments. But it costs a fortune to upgrade networks to carry huge picture files. The usual result: Clinicians, still unable to access the images on their personal computers, continue to order up lots of expensive film that is shuttled about on mail-carts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But M.D. Anderson in Houston found a relatively simple and inexpensive way to disseminate digital images, without any significant upfront investment. Called iSite Enterprise and developed by Silicon Valley upstart Stentor Inc., the software harnesses the Internet to let doctors review X-rays, CT and MRI scans, with just a few mouse clicks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's just a huge win for the institution," says Dr. Kevin McEnery, an associate professor of radiology at the medical center. He says that while the hospital still relies heavily on film, doctors aren't exclusively dependent on it anymore, and even the most computer-phobic physicians find the Stentor solution "pretty cool." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In an era when doctors' demand for increasingly detailed diagnostic information is colliding with the need to rein in soaring health-care costs, a growing number of hospitals are choosing software venders such as Stentor, which is based in South San Francisco, to make the jump to digital affordable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Stentor's iSite system moves &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; files throughout a hospital network or to a referring doctor across town. To use iSite, a clinician reviewing a set of X-rays logs into a PC and double clicks on the name of the patient whose images she wants to review. Instead of sending the whole hundred-megabyte file at once, Stentor uses a mathematical formula that delivers information in pieces. The effect on the viewer is imperceptible -- entire images appear to arrive at once -- because the pictures travel as fast as human perception, or a few megabits a second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The epiphany is that humans don't look at 100 megabytes at once," says Stentor Chief Executive Oran Muduroglu. He uses the analogy of a reader who doesn't absorb every word on the page when he picks up the newspaper: He scans first for headlines before zeroing in on a specific article's particulars. "Our technology," he says, "mimics the way a human interacts with any information." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To date, Stentor has raised $25 million in venture-capital money. The leading venture partners are: Lancet Capital in New York; Sanderling Biomedical Ventures in Menlo Park Calif.; Gilo Ventures in Woodside, Calif.; and EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The closely held company has also signed up some big-name customers. Among them: Children's Hospital in Denver and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, where the technology was co-developed by Dr. Paul Chang, who is a co-founder and board member of Stentor. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is also an investor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mr. Muduroglu, 39 years old, previously had worked at a major medical-imaging company. The company, incorporated in 1998, was named for the Stentor in the Iliad, the soldier who could speak with the voice of 50 men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco opened a new outpatient facility more than two years ago, the big health maintenance organization bought five dedicated clinical-review stations for the urgent care, oncology and pulmonary departments in the same building. But most of the doctors at Kaiser remained unconnected to them, and so Kaiser's radiology department kept printing up film to the tune of $2,000 a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After rejecting other proposals, Kaiser chose Stentor. "I kind of liked the underdog," says Dr. John Rego, chief of radiology at Kaiser in San Francisco. Now, he says, all 300 doctors there can pull up medical images instantly on their PCs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Stentor charges customers on a per-use basis, with fees ranging between $1.50 and $2.50 a study. (An MRI study, for instance, can contain as many as a thousand images.) Hospitals pay for only the studies they use and are charged only once even with repeated use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company declined to provide financial information, but it doesn't dispute an estimate that it had revenue of about $1.5 million in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mr. Muduroglu predicts revenue will soar after Stentor launches in November its iSite Radiology and iVault products, which are geared for radiology departments. The company's main target for these products will be community hospitals that haven't yet invested in expensive digital systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tiny Stentor has some larger partners. IDX Inc., a medical-information company in Burlington, Vt., markets iSite to its customers. And soon, technology giant International Business Machines Corp. says, it will announce a pact to provide field support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Even so, Stentor has a lot of large competitors trying to improve the transmission of medical images, including Eastman Kodak Co.'s and General Electric Co.'s medical units. In addition, Amicas Inc., a six-year-old company in Newton, Mass., sells a similar technology to customers that include Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both Amicas and Stentor tout their own products as superior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have won head to head on five occasions and never lost," boasts Amicas Chief Executive Hamid Tabatabaie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Quite the contrary," replies Stentor's Mr. Muduroglu: "It's mathematically impossible for them to beat us, delivering the same high-quality resolution." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Credit: Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By James Bandler</author><abstract>Stentor's iSite system moves big data files throughout a hospital network or to a referring doctor across town.
