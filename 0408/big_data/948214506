<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; By sifting through thousands of data sources to help determine which ones have the most impact on how gasoline is sold, Opera Solutions LLC was able to help a chain of 1,000 stations add $38 million to its annual gross margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company did it by developing algorithms to determine the best combination of price and volume at each station each day. Before that, the gas station chain, which Opera Solutions doesn't have permission to name, would set its prices by having the managers of each station look out the window to see what the neighboring stations were charging that day and pick a price that was two to four cents a gallon less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across all segments of the retail industry, a similar story is playing out. Retailers have long had an appetite for data, but the availability of new sources of data, along with the ability to store and process far greater amounts of it, are presenting the retail industry with a chance to understand their customers in a way that wasn't possible just a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Not since my early days at Teradata [Corp.] when retailers discovered data warehousing for the first time, have I been party to a company that is having this much activity this broadly," said Bill Nowacki, an executive director with Opera Solutions, a provider of &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="hit"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; software and consulting services whose backers include Accel-KKR and Silver Lake Sumeru. To help its gas-station customer come up with the best price each day, Opera Solutions analyzed thousands of potential signals: the proximity of a competitor, the weather, the relative price of gas and a local consumer-price index Opera scrapes together from thousands of separate data points. Retail has always been a rapid adopter of data technologies since the invention of tools such as data warehouses and enterprise-resource-planning software helped the industry squeeze inefficiencies out of their supply chain decades ago. Even tracking data about customers is nothing new -- anyone with a keychain full of loyalty cards can attest to that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is new is the vast amount of data available to companies outside their internal databases. Social-media data, blog posts and comments are some of the most frequently cited examples, but the Internet is a trove of different data for retailers to make use of, including data about competitive pricing, location of other products and competitors, demographics, and even weather. What is also new is that the amount of data they are able to store and process internally is growing fast, due to shrinking costs of storage and processing, as well as the emergence of new software programs for harnessing all that data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not just data specialists like Opera Solutions that see a big opportunity here. Companies building infrastructure to enable retailers to build up their in-house analytics capabilities -- such as Hadoop companies Cloudera Inc. and MapR Technologies Inc. -- or Revolution Analytics Inc., a maker of statistical analysis software, also have zeroed in on this sector. These companies have raised capital from some of the best-known venture firms, including Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Ignition Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, New Enterprise Associates and North Bridge Venture Partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based 1010data Inc., which is backed by Norwest Venture Partners, has landed several customers in retail, including Dollar General Corp. and Vitamin Shoppe Inc., for its hosted data warehouse -- essentially an Excel spreadsheet that can scale to a trillion rows. Customers dump a lot of traditional data into its systems, such as point-of-sale data and inventory data, but many are incorporating outside sources of data, such as weather, housing and employment data, said Tim Negris, 1010data's vice president of marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of its customers, AutoZone Inc., even uses 1010data to ingest local car registration data so that it can customize its inventory at each location: Neighborhoods filled with older cars will have plenty of spare parts on stock, while stores in neighborhoods with mostly new cars will carry lots of vanity items, Mr. Negris said. Along with infrastructure and analytics companies, there are also several start-ups that see a chance to build a big business by bringing retailers new streams of data. These include companies like Euclid Inc., which sells a system of sensors and software that provides retailers with data about how people move in and around the store, and Prism Skylabs Inc., which recently launched a software to turn images from security cameras into usable traffic analytics for stores. Though this trend is well past the early-adopters phase, there could still be some challenges to making &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; a standard practice across retail, analysts say. For one thing, companies could start to run up against privacy problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To what extent is the relationship in jeopardy because retailers are using stuff that customers don't want them to see?" said Hung LeHong, a research vice president with Gartner. "Can customers opt out of a retailer following their social media activity? These are questions that will have to be addressed as this trend develops, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, there is a shortage of skills needed to implement these technologies. A recent McKinsey study found that by 2018, there could be a shortfall of as many as 190,000 workers with deep analytical knowledge, as well as another 1.5 million managers and analysts who know how to integrate analytics into business processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Scott Denne &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Denne, Scott</author><abstract>"Not since my early days at Teradata [Corp.] when retailers discovered data warehousing for the first time, have I been party to a company that is having this much activity this broadly," said Bill Nowacki, an executive director with Opera Solutions, a provider of big-data software and consulting services whose backers include Accel-KKR and Silver Lake Sumeru.</abstract><title>Data Specialists Can Help Retailers Know Customers</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/948214506?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Mar 28, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>948214506</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
