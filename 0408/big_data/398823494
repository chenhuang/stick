<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt;   HOPKINTON, Mass. -- EMC Corp. Chairman Michael C. Ruettgers exercised stock options last year in which he realized $67.1 million in gains, much greater than those of the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition, Mr. Ruettgers received salary, bonus and other compensation of $2.9 million, an increase of about 45% over 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EMC said in its annual proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Mr. Ruettgers, who was also chief executive of the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;-storage concern last year, exercised 900,000 options in 2000. That represented 29% of options exercisable during the year. His remaining 2.23 million exercisable options at the end of last year were valued at $140.6 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In 1999, Mr. Reutters cashed in about 20% of his options, valued at $13.4 million. Mr, Ruettgers stepped down as EMC's chief executive last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokesman for EMC said the sale of the stock options was a "fairly normal and routine exercising for Mr. Ruettgers" that was done for "tax-planning and diversification purposes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The filing also disclosed that EMC is seeking shareholder approval to double its shares outstanding to six billion. Although the company said it had no immediate plans for issuance, a big increase in authorization often signals a company wants the flexibility to use its stock as takeover currency. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author></author><abstract>EMC said in its annual proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Mr. [Michael C.
