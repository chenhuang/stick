<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; As federal agencies pursue improvements in effectiveness - without increasing their costs - contractor-supplied technology services will remain in demand. But the long-term market outlook suggests spending on these services will be flat or decline slightly in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a new Deltek report, federal spending on vendor-furnished IT services is projected to decrease to $60.4 billion in 2017, down from $60.9 billion in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal IT services cover a wide range of work, including program management, systems integration, software development and technology training, as well as IT outsourcing of federal systems, applications and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some areas of federal technology spending could see sharp declines, Deltek forecasts a flat IT services market, driven by agencies' efforts to consolidate data centers, shift to cloud computing, make use of "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" and satisfy cybersecurity needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deltek is predicting some growth over the next year, before spending slows and then levels off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, federal agencies' work on these key initiatives, from cybersecurity to data center consolidation, provide select short-term growth opportunities within IT services. These boosts should help keep the industry stable as funding is cut for other, lower-priority areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the longer term, some of the new trends could eventually lead to softening in overall demand. As cloud computing, for instance, gains wider adoption and agencies move to an IT-as-a-service model, demand for customized solutions and integration services are likely to decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, federal policies could put more pressure on labor rates, making the competitive landscape even fiercer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angela Petty is senior principal research analyst at Herndon-based Deltek, which conducts research on the government contracting market and can be found at www.deltek.com. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>petty, Angela</author><abstract>According to a new Deltek report, federal spending on vendor-furnished IT services is projected to decrease to $60.4 billion in 2017, down from $60.9 billion in 2012.</abstract><title>Outlook for federal spending on IT services is flat</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1271544094?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jan 21, 2013</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1271544094</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
