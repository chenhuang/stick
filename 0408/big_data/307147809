<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt;      I get a lot of junk mail. Like most of my friends, I throw most of the letters away unopened. I do save the catalogues,however; I pass them to my wife, who no doubt is one of the mainstays of the $21 billion junk-mail industry (or "direct mail," as its practitioners prefer). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Together, she and I have been rented, matched, merged, purged, stockpiled, downloaded, parsed and sorted-by zip, carrier walk and zip-plus-four. We've been scavenged by data pickers who sifted through our driving records and auto registrations, our deed and our mortgage, in search of what direct mailers see as the keys to our identities; our sexes, ages, the ages of our cars, the equity we hold in our home. The scavengers record this data and merge it with other streams of revelatory data (the magazines we subscribe to, the organizations we support, how much credit we've got left) and then spit it all out (for a price) to virtually anyone who wants it. I feel so cheap, so used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Quietly, the direct-mail industry in America has built itself an immense, private intelligence network in which nearly each and every one of us now resides. The biggest companies know a lot about us, and they're getting to know us even better. Lists are the raw materials. There are "compiled" lists built of records bought wholesale from state governments, or built piece by piece by the scavengers. There are "response" lists created whenever people subscribe to magazines, order products through the mail or answer consumer surveys. Advertisers can rent lists that tell what car you bought, whether you like dried fruit and nuts, whether you have a kid, whether you or your wife is pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      No one is spared a list life, not even subscribers to the New Yorker. The magazine began marketing its readers for the first time last year. Catalogue companies, magazines, causes and concerns can rent the list for $90 per 1,000 names. The magazine expressly bars its use, however, for such crass endeavors as sweepstakes, real estate offers, politics and fund-raising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      And now we all get listed at earlier and earlier ages. Sesame Street magazine sells its subscriber list. So do Snoopy Magazine and Mickey Mouse magazine. The Hasbro toy company peddles the 454,427 names of individuals who sent in proof-of-purchase labels to get rebates on My Little Pony games, Jem doll cassettes and G.I. Joe figurines. Recently, the mail brought the Right Start Catalogue, a kind of Sharper Image for babies. It beat the baby home by a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Individually, these lists are mostly harmless. So what if a stranger knows I subscribe to Country Living? Within the last five years, however, advanced "merge/purge" software has given the data collectors the power to layer list upon list, cheaply and quickly, and thereby-if they wish-to turn lean lists into thick dossiers. Suppose my name appears on 100 lists (a conservative estimate, by the way). The data on these lists, if merged, would form a kind of "me," a character with opinions, traits and an entire personality defined by what I've registered, signed-and what I've purchased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      The number of people now collected and processed is staggering. TRW keeps monthly tabs on 143 million consumers, roughly 80 percent of all consumers over 18. Donnelly Marketing of Stamford, Conn., tracks 80 million households-90 percent of all households in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      The keepers of &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; say they do it for the consumer's benefit. But data have a way of being used for purposes other than originally intended. For instance, in 1984 (I mean, really, of all years), the Selective Service System used a Farrell's Ice Cream list it had rented to contact young men as they came of draft age. The list was made up of the names of children who, in registering for an ice-cream promotion, had written down their birth dates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      My uneasiness about the magnitude of information collected led me to this question: Who wants me? On whose lists do I reside? I set out to find out, to trace my direct mail to its sources, have myself profiled, mapped and clustered. Just who do they think I am? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      I began the search for my direct-mail self on the top floor of the Clarence Mitchell Jr. Courthouse, in Baltimore. In this mundane room, in microfilm files 1611-278 and 1611-281, there are details stored that I would not tell a friend, let alone a stranger-what I paid for my house, the amount I borrowed to buy it and how much I was able to scrape together for the down payment. If this information remained at the courthouse, it would be one thing. It doesn't. Anyone can collect it and sell it. One day last year data prospectors from Rufus S. Lusk &amp;amp; Son got their hands on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Lusk operates primarily in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, collecting home-equity and property-tax information, indexing it, then selling it to realtors, landscapers, decorators-anyone who stands to profit when someone buys a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      "It's all public information," Carol Stewart assured me. She is vice president in charge of Lusk's branch in Timonium, Md. To test her conviction, I asked to see the real estate records of Kurt L. Schmoke, Baltimore's mayor. No doubt it would have taken me hours of prodding to get the mayor's address from his press office, let alone the amount of his mortgage. But there it all was, right on the screen of Stewart's microfiche viewer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      My heart leapt. I asked to see the records on my own home, and those too appeared. Of far more interest to me, however, were the adjacent entries, the homes of my neighbors. Ah, Richard and Carol, Fred and Betsy, Nancy, Margaret! I know a few things you don't know I know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Seeing my name there, toiling in its own small way to help Lusk make a profit, gave me an odd feeling. My affairs were being monitored, yet I knew nothing about it. Who else was watching? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      "The moment of truth," Doug Anderson, a vice president of Claritas Corp. in Alexandria was saying. Anderson and I were sitting at a computer in a glass-enclosed room just off the company's sleek blue-gray lobby. Claritas, Latin for "clarity," is a target-marketing company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Claritas was founded by Jonathan Robbin, a man who delights in discovering correlations between seemingly unrelated behaviors. For example, he knows that people who listen to religious radio don't eat salted nuts. Robbin pioneered the technique of blending census data, market research and millions of other records and then analyzing the results to predict consumer behavior. Claritas broke the country into 40 neighborhood types, gave each a catchy name ("Blue-Blood Estates," "Shotguns and Pickups") ranked them in order of affluence, and dubbed the system PRIZM (Potential Rating Index for Zip Markets). The theory is that the Blue Bloods of California behave much like the Blue Bloods of New Jersey, although the former may have better tans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      "The whole idea is that you can now assign every neighborhood in the United States to one of these 40 types," Robbin said. "These are enclaves where people live at one phase of their lives, or are living because they share the same interest and needs as everybody else." Anderson typed in the number of my block group, the smallest census division, consisting of an average of 340 households. In census-speak, I live in state 24, county 510, census tract 902, block group 4. In PRIZM, that makes me a member of cluster 237, "Levittown, U.S.A." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      The thrill of self-discovery. These are things there I never knew about myself: I am an ice-hockey fan. I buy a lottery ticket one or more times each week. I went bowling more than 25 times last year. I belong to a union, install my own faucets, frequent pancake houses and doughnut shops. I am not at all likely to chew tobacco or buy comedy tapes and records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      By transforming themselves from simple reporters to avid marketers, data companies in the past several years have shaken a fragile compact between themselves and consumers. Now, without any agreement from me, marketing companies can gain access to my credit history-not to provide me with credit, but to sell me something. TRW, for example, turned my wife and me over to CPC Associates, a list company in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., which in turn rented us to American Mailing Co-Op in Plymouth, Minn., which decided we were a "special" family and offered us a peek at Wilderness Resort, 54 miles outside Washington. This special family didn't want a peek at Wilderness Resort. We threw the mail out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Is that what this all comes down to: I simply don't like to open junk mail? I hear some of you: Hey, you don't like it, you throw it away. What's the harm? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      Well, if all this is so good for us, why don't these &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; keepers drop us a little note candidly explaining the true extent to which they use our names: "We and a thousand other companies are going to appropriate your name, match it, store it, rent it, swap it; we'll evaluate your geo-demographic profile, determine your ethnic heritage, calculate your propensity to consume. We'll track you for the rest of your consuming life-pitch you baby toys when you're pregnant, condos when you're 50." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      The data keepers say we have nothing to fear, that they are scrupulous about protecting our records. Yes. But the world changes. Events occur and movements swell that cause people to sacrifice the rights of their peers. It is an interesting exercise to imagine the big marketing databases put to use in other times, other places, by less trustworthy souls. What, for instance, might health insurers do with the subscription lists of gay publications such as the Advocate and the New York Native? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      If I am only uneasy, and not panicked, it is because I continue to harbor faith that the direct mailers and name harvesters don't really know what they're doing. Some still can't tell that my wife, who goes by her maiden name, Gleason, is indeed my wife-we get two copies of most of our direct mail. And there is an ever growing list of catalogue companies that insists that one of us is Gleason Larson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      What delights me most, however, is that the folks at Victoria's Secret still send me their catalogue, that zesty album of gorgeous babes in skimpy lingerie; they still believe I'm a woman named Laura Lange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ILLUSTRATION,,Michael H.
