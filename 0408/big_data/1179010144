<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; The technology story of the year might not turn out to be the launch of a tablet, a new smartphone, &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; or cloud computing. The biggest story in technology might well end up as a squabble over bookkeeping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its quarterly figures released Tuesday, U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard announced an $8.8 billion write-down. The company ascribed more than $5 billion of that impairment charge to accounting practices at Autonomy, the Cambridge-based company it bought amid a huge fanfare (and some raised eyebrows at the 79% premium it paid on the stock price) in August 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The write-down announcement caught everyone, including Autonomy's founder and former CEO Mike Lynch, by surprise. Mr. Lynch, speaking to The Wall Street Journal, said he had been ambushed by H-P and wasn't contacted in advance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since then battle lines are being drawn up. On the one side is Mr. Lynch, where he has been joined by Autonomy's former accountants, Deloitte LLC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Deloitte categorically denies that it had any knowledge of any accounting improprieties or misrepresentations in Autonomy1s financial statements," the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We conducted our audit work in full compliance with regulation and professional standards." The company wasn't employed to do due diligence on the acquisition and last audited Autonomy's finances for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other side stands H-P and a number of London-based analysts. Alan Pelz-Sharpe, research director at industry analysts 451 Research, was one who has long been skeptical about Autonomy's successes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wrote a report a year after Autonomy's sale to HP, but before these allegations were made, in which he listed many of his concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As someone who has watched Autonomy for a long time, it was always a difficult company to cover," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the jewel in Autonomy's crown was its IDOL (Intelligent Data Operating Layer) server, a product that allowed companies to search so-called unstructured data, information that doesn't easily slot into the rows and tables of a conventional database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IDOL should have been headlining in major deals, but we just didn't see those happen. We saw far more visibility of companies literally 1/20th the size of Autonomy doing deals. You just had to ask the question--where were the deals? It was an opaque company to get information out of." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Pelz-Sharpe did acknowledge that given the nature of many of their clients, it would not always have been possible. "Certainly in the early days of Autonomy, a substantial proportion of their clients were in the defense and intelligence sectors." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another analyst who has been bearish on Autonomy since 2008 is Daud Khan, software analyst at Berenberg Bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I suspected that there was an issue around revenue recognition, reported organic growth rates and the true underlying margins of the business." Mr. Khan said that, having followed Autonomy, in his opinion the company over-reported its organic growth rates while at the same time it had aggressively recognized revenue in order to show higher revenue growth as well as reporting higher margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Schultz, H-P's general counsel in an interview, gave a strong indication of the focus of H-P's investigations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said more than $200 million in revenue had been accelerated, mis-categorized and created over a two-year period beginning in 2009--or about 12% of Autonomy's $1.61 billion in revenue for 2009 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a person familiar with Autonomy, "the interesting thing about misclassified hardware is even if you classified the way they say it should be classified, the revenue numbers of the company, and the profit numbers of the company don't change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "How on earth with this so-called accounting issue can you justify writing off $5 billion?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But before descending into accounting trench warfare, take a step back and look at the bigger picture; and the picture is very big indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is hard to see how this is going to end well. There is no win-win here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the accounts have been pored over, dissected, checked and rechecked either Mr. Lynch is going to be vindicated and H-P's reputation is going to be traduced; or vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there are a great many more players than just these two. Autonomy was one of the few jewels in the British tech sector crown. Mr. Lynch was hailed as Britain's own Bill Gates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just this week the company was being lauded in the university city of Cambridge, where it is based, as a shining example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it turns out that the company was built on sand, the U.K. tech sector is going to take a serious blow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what of the role of the analysts? The U.K. is trying desperately to galvanize its public markets to be more amenable to tech stocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There have been recent proposals to make it easier for companies to list, reducing the reporting requirements. Should H-P be vindicated, London will take a serious blow to its reputation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Ben Rooney at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Ben Rooney &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Rooney, Ben</author><abstract></abstract><title>Battle Lines Drawn After Write-Down of Autonomy</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1179010144?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Nov 21, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1179010144</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
