<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO -  Here is a look at some of the highlights, lowlights and scarier happenings taking place at the annual RSA security conference here this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   DIABETICS BEWARE: HACKERS CAN TAKE OVER YOUR INSULIN PUMPS. Panel discussions piled fear-mongering upon fear-mongering. Of the more egregious examples: One RSA panel discussion about trojans, malware and targeted hacks included a slide featuring a month-old online ad for a hitman's services. The hitman offered to "eliminate someone while keeping above suspicion" within 30 days for $9,133. It's still not entirely clear what this had to do with trojans, or cyberattacks, but it was scary nonetheless. In another talk, Stuart McClure, McAfee's chief technology officer, demonstrated how easily a diabetic's insulin pump could be commandeered by hackers. This could "affect a patient's health dramatically," Mr. McClure told a crowd of hundreds. He concluded his speech this way, "When communications cannot be secured, it can lead to death." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   '&lt;span class="hit"&gt;BIG DATA&lt;/span&gt;' IS IN. FIREWALLS ARE OUT. Buzzwords like "virtualization," "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" and "cloud security solutions" are very much in vogue among security folk these days. Mention of firewalls and usernames and passwords elicits smug chuckles. The mind-set of the security industry has changed from one that thinks it can keep malware and bad guys out with antivirus solutions and firewall protection, to one that tries to identify and control the bad guys once they inevitably break in. In the last two weeks, both I.B.M. and Cisco announced new security intelligence systems that monitor and analyze threats in real time using the "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" they cull from their information technology systems and networks, respectively. A number of companies already do this, albeit on a smaller scale. Solera Networks, Narus, Niometrics, AccessData, Log Logic, Niksun and dozens of others at the conference all market similar services. They look for patterns or telltale signs among large quantities of unstructured data to flag vulnerabilities before a security breach occurs, or to spot a breach as it is happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   FOR SECURITY FOLK, SMARTPHONES ARE THE BANE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. I.T. professionals used to have a realistic sense of the data flowing in and out of their networks. With employees plugging their personal smartphones, tablets and laptops into employers' networks and carrying sensitive data around with them, that's no longer the case. The inmates have basically taken control, and security professionals are desperate for ways to stymie the outpouring of information. A number of panels focused on the "B.Y.O.D.," or bring your own device, phenomenon. Among them: "Does B.Y.O.D. Spell RISK?" and "B.Y.O.D(evice) Without B.Y.O.I(nsecurity)." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   OLD SCHOOL HACKERS STILL DRAW A CROWD. Standing merrily among the hundreds of security vendors pitching souped-up firewalls and secure cloud solutions on an expo floor on Tuesday, the convicted-hacker-cum-security-consultant Kevin Mitnick recounted some of his exploits of yesteryear. He showed onlookers - many of them already anxiety-ridden chief information officers - how easily corporate assets could be pilfered using a thumb drive pulled from a dumpster. On Wednesday, a line to secure Mr. Mitnick's autograph snaked around the auditorium, while other people settled for snapping photographs of Mr. Mitnick with their cellphones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   'WE LOVE ANONYMOUS.' Contrary to conventional wisdom, security folk love Anonymous, the loose hacking collective that says it has taken on groups as diverse as the C.I.A.,  Interpol and Stratfor. Several security experts I interviewed called the group "a welcome wake-up call." For years, chief information officers had to pound their fists on the table to convince their bosses to allocate more resources to information security. Now Anonymous does that for them. "Anonymous added a silent 'J-O-B' before security," one conference attendee said. "The more companies they hack, the more vulnerabilities get exposed, the greater our job security." He spoke -no pun intended-on condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stuart Mcclure, a Mcafee Executive, with an Insulin Pump.
