<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Everyone from rock groups to encyclopedia publishers is scrambling to come out with CD-ROM programs, so it was probably only a matter of time before corporations decided to put their yearly show-and-tell statements -- annual reports -- on the silvery disks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, it seems, is the start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Oracle Corporation, a &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; base software company, offered some of its shareholders a compact-disk version of its annual report last month. Another Silicon Valley software house, Adobe Systems Inc., will produce its CD-ROM annual report next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It makes sense for companies to use their high-tech tools to show themselves off to their shareholders," said Philip Bishop, editor of the Bishop Report, a newsletter in Narragansett, R.I.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies are enthusiastic about the advantages of CD-ROM annual reports. Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., created a multimedia show with video clips of its senior executives. The executives talked about their business and how their data-serving software would be used as computer, communications and television technology came together to create the so-called information highway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The magic of CD-ROM is that you can make a little show of it," said Dick Brass, a senior vice president of Oracle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., is using the CD-ROM report to show off its popular document formatting and searching program, Acrobat. It displays the full-color 56-page annual report on any desktop operating system and allows users to navigate the text quickly, searching by key words or terms, like "losses" or "special charges." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About two million American households with personal computers are equipped with CD-ROM players. (CD-ROM stands for compact disk, read-only memory, which means it cannot be changed.) By 1995, that number of households is expected to rise to 8.6 million, according to the Link Research Corporation, a market research firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholder demand for the flashy software annual reports is not known. Oracle has given out 2,000 copies, but there is no way to tell how many have been used. Even so, Mr. Brass said, they may not go to waste. "An unread printed annual report is just garbage," he said. "The CD-ROM's make good coasters for drinks." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, though, the CD-ROM annual reports are just alternatives to the glossy printed versions. If the disks ever replaced printed reports, companies would save tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on printing costs because pressing the disk is much cheaper, said a spokeswoman for Adobe, Lavon Peck. For now, however, it is an extra cost, though neither company had a precise estimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Securities and Exchange Commission still requires paper records of the financial statements of public companies, though it is moving toward an electronic filing system, called Edgar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the S.E.C.'s objective has nothing to do with entertainment. It wants to streamline the record collection, storage and retrieval work that results from 15,000 corporations filing more than 12 million pages of documents a year. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times ,Â Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>Lohr, Steve</author><abstract>Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., is using the CD-ROM report to show off its popular document formatting and searching program, Acrobat.
