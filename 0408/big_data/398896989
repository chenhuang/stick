<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones Newswires &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interest-rate and inflation worries combined to drive Treasury prices sharply lower across the board, with the benchmark 10-year-note yield rising to a high of 4.53%, the top end of its recent range. The 30-year bond shed more than a full point to yield 4.73%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market got a brief lift earlier in the session after a report from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence fell to a two- year low in October. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, fell as far as 4.43% intraday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 20/32 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, at 97 26/32. Its yield rose to 4.530% from 4.452% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 1 2/32 point at 109 14/32 to yield 4.732%, up from 4.664%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some traders said a general sense of uncertainty and concern has pervaded the market since the nomination of former Federal Reserve governor Ben Bernanke as successor to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was a front-runner and his nomination was not a huge surprise, but it has reminded everyone of the uncertainty we'll face next year," said Rick Klingman, head of treasury trading at ABN Amro in New York. "We've already seen some spikes in inflation, and there's concern about a period of unsettling numbers in the first quarter and a new Fed chairman trying to prove himself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 4.50% level has been a psychological mark above which the 10- year note has been unable to hold over the past two weeks, when it traded in a 4.38% to 4.53% range. "It's a very important level," Mr. Klingman said. "But with no &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; to chew on this week, it could go either way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Mitchell, manager of government trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore, said a sustained breach of the 4.53% level could be a prelude to higher yields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York, said a possible rise in the federal funds rate -- now at 3.75% -- to 4.50% by early 2006 is likely to signal a shift into a new trading range, since Treasurys rarely trade below the fed funds rate. Higher interest rates "make sense," Mr. Crescenzi said, if the economy continues to rebound from hurricane-related damage, and growth continues to keep pace into 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bond market is expecting the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the fed funds rate to 4.00% Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;                              AUCTION RESULTS&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;   Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions.

"The stock-buyback program is substantial -- representing about one-eighth of the company's outstanding shares at the current market price -- and, in our view, a permanent shift to less conservative financial policies," said S&amp;amp;P credit analyst Cynthia Werneth in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch downgraded DuPont's senior unsecured debt, also two notches, to single-A from double-A-minus. At the same time, it assigned a single-A rating to the bank-credit facility. The rating outlook is stable. The ratings affect about $9.5 billion of debt, Fitch said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following suit, Moody's lowered the long-term ratings of DuPont by two notches to A2 from Aa3. The outlook for the rating is negative. The downgrade reflects "management's willingness to adjust its financial philosophy to one that can tolerate more leverage than Moody's expected at the Aa3 rating level," Moody's said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Convertibles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Power company Calpine Corp., San Jose, Calif., is facing a new claim that it has defaulted on one of its convertible bonds. Hedge fund Whitebox Advisors this week sent a notice of default to the debt-laden company claiming it has defaulted on its 6% convertibles due 2014. The claim is similar to one that hedge fund Harbert Management made earlier this year. Convertibles are hybrid securities that pay a coupon like a bond, but convert into stock under certain conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds dominate this hybrid securities market, which gradually is picking up after a miserable first half, prompted by low volatility, a flat stock market and tight risk premiums on bonds. Signs are that these funds have been turning more aggressive in their search for profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitebox is claiming that Calpine is ignoring language in its indenture that says if the convertibles trade under a certain level for five consecutive days, the company must call the bonds, said Whitebox lawyer Jeff Ross of Anthony Ostlund &amp;amp; Bear in Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That level is equivalent to 95% of the converted value based on the current stock price -- currently around 60 cents on the dollar, the price Calpine would have to pay. The convertibles were quoted around 59 cents on the dollar late yesterday, according to traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Calpine believes that this tactic of using a notice of default and a statement to the press represents an effort by Harbert and Whitebox to put pressure on Calpine to resolve issues that have been the subject of litigation since mid-July," the company said in a statement. "Calpine has moved to dismiss Harbert's complaint as having no basis, and intends to move to dismiss Whitebox's copy-cat complaint in due course. Calpine believes that both complaints have no merit." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Calpine doesn't remedy the default claim within 30 days, Whitebox could exercise its right to accelerate payment of the notes at par value with accrued interest, Mr. Ross said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitebox and Harbert combined hold $200 million of the $725 million offering of convertibles, which were sold in September 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aparajita Saha-Bubna and Liz Rappaport contributed to this article. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Johnson, Steven C</author><abstract>"He was a front-runner and his nomination was not a huge surprise, but it has reminded everyone of the uncertainty we'll face next year," said Rick Klingman, head of treasury trading at ABN Amro in New York.
