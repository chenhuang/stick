<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt;    Rob Duckwall lives in the kind of house he grew up in. It's a big brick colonial, nearly 80 years old, surrounded by azaleas and oak trees atop an ivy-covered hill. The sunroom is painted a cheerful yellow, with three walls of white-framed windows. There is a vestibule inside the front door, a small gracious space for shaking off umbrellas and collecting one's manners before entering the foyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The house is in a lacrosse-and-chardonnay section of old Baltimore called Guilford, near Johns Hopkins University. Rob, 35, grew up in a neighborhood in Roanoke that looked much the same, with hills and dogwoods and cracked sidewalks and elegant old homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That should be reassuring to him, but it's not. It's embarrassing. The Rob who bought this house last year was a different guy: confident, expansive. Back then, he didn't have many doubts about being able to pay for the place. Almost everybody he knew seemed to be investing in technology companies, and stocks were soaring. Now, times have changed, and he feels a little stranded in this lovely, costly trophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On a sunny spring morning, Rob is several feet beneath it all, working in the basement. His office is an hour's train ride away in Washington, so he tries to work from home two days a week. At the moment, his wife and 21/2-year-old son are at a play group at a church up the street, but they should be home for lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob's tiny basement office -- he can stand up and touch the ceiling and the walls on either side -- is a cozy nest of technology. His Compaq laptop and an Apple Macintosh sit side by side on a pine Shaker-style desk. In swivel range of the wooden desk chair are a cordless phone, a flip-top digital phone, the TV remote, a digital camera, a walkie-talkie, a color printer, a compact disc changer and receiver and scores of CDs, from Pavarotti to Springsteen. A television with built-in VCR extends from the wall on a metal arm. Scooby-Doo and "Toy Story" tapes are stacked on the TV, which is muted and tuned to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He glides the mouse attached to the laptop and clicks, and the Zip drive, a little black box next to the computer, begins to flash and whir. Rob is downloading a screen grab, or the picture of a page from the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On the TV's silent screen, CNBC flashes a graphic: The Nasdaq is up 10 points. The ticker scrolls across the bottom of the screen. One symbol catches Rob's eye: QCOM, for Qualcomm, up 62 cents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A chime sounds and an instant message pops up on the laptop. His mother had checked in earlier; now she's signing off -- "I've gotta get some housework done -- are having people for dinner," she writes. This is as far as either of his parents has &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    gone into the world of computers. They have little idea what their son does as creative director for an Internet start-up called SwapDrive Inc. It's one of those jobs you hear about all the time these days, but who really knows what it means? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob calls up the screen grab on the Mac. What he sees is a calendar page from a company called vFirm, one of SwapDrive's business partners. His mission is to dress up the page, make it look slick. First he builds a frame around the calendar. On a blank gray bar to the left, he types in five category headings -- such as Schedule a Meeting and Manage Tasks -- and begins grabbing snatches of color to put behind the words. As his right hand strokes and clicks the mouse, blue light flickers across his thin, freckled face like the glow of an electronic campfire. Control panels flash on and off the screen so fast they're almost subliminal. His brown eyes dart back and forth, a waking state of REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He is building buttons. Shading, layering, feathering edges, so when he's finished the five headings will look as if they rest on raised tabs that you can push down by clicking on them, like buttons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Now the Nasdaq is down 7 points. An hour later it's up 22. Dunstan, the family's mixed-breed dog, barks, then trots down to be petted. The laptop bloops and bleeps a few more times as instant messages hit, this time from guys at work. The Nasdaq is up 24. Whole days can pass like this, flashing along like a cursor across a screen. Even on days when he takes the train into Washington, Rob will come home and work in the basement until 1 a.m. Weekends are little different, except he might put the TV on ESPN instead of CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Eventually, Rob realizes lunchtime has long passed and his wife and son are still not home. He calls her cell phone from his cordless phone. It doesn't go through, so he calls her cell phone from his cell phone. That doesn't work either. What's she doing? Finished with the basic page design, he pops a disk back into the Zip drive and e- mails his work to vFirm for approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Finally, around 2:30, Dunstan barks again. Rob's wife, Caitlin, and son, Logan, are back from the play group. They had gone to lunch with another mom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob is upstairs to greet them. "Hey, buddy!" he calls as Logan walks into the sunlit kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I hurt my knee," Logan says, pulling up one leg of his denim overalls to show his dad the red mark. Rob kneels down for a look, and quickly realizes it's not Logan's only problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "He's pretty ripe," Rob says, making a face. "I'll change him." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As Caitlin stops in the foyer to thumb through the mail, Rob hauls his little boy upstairs. Logan is back down in moments, whooshing around like Buzz Lightyear and insisting he doesn't need to take a nap. Caitlin, tired and slumped in an armchair, lets him run for a minute, then gets up and whisks him away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That's it. That's why Rob stays home two days a week. And the bad part is, he feels anxious the whole time he's with Logan. He needs to be working. If he doesn't work, this could all go away. And all too often these days, it hits him that even if he works 24 hours a day, he could still lose it all to the same unexpected force that brought him to this point in life in the first place: the new economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob is no dot-com millionaire. On paper, his net worth did hit a million dollars at some point last year. But much of that is gone, and the whole image of the tech tycoon makes him queasy. He hates coffee, drives a 1997 Honda Civic, vacations with his parents and wishes he could play softball more often. From the antique oil portrait of his great-great-great-grandfather William Greenway Russell in the living room to his mild mountain accent, Rob is the model of a good Virginia son bred to respect security and tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He was building a career as a medical illustrator when the Internet happened, and it hijacked Rob's ambitions. He can draw a human heart in scientific detail, down to the texture of the muscle, but he attained this house -- with its in-ground pool, brushed-steel KitchenAid appliances and carved woodwork -- by arranging blips on a computer screen and by investing in companies that created technology he barely understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He was not alone, of course, in thinking he had found a quick, easy route to the kind of comfort his own father spent a patient lifetime building up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investing during the 1990s was the biggest Lotto game of all time, promising money to the masses in the same way earlier generations came to expect ready supplies of potable water. In a mere four years, from 1995 to 1999, the total market value of all corporate stock in the United States more than doubled, to $1.96 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Board. The amount of money U.S. households held in mutual funds nearly tripled over that time. Stocks made up more than half the financial assets of U.S. families in 1998, while in 1989 they had been only about a quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The boom was driven by technology: The mushrooming power of microprocessors hitched to the addictive frenzy of the Internet not only created a new industry, it empowered millions of people to participate and invest in it. Companies that tapped into that could write their own ticket. In 1999 and 2000, a total of about $163 billion in venture capital flowed into U.S. companies -- more than double the amount for the previous nine years combined, according to figures from the National Venture Capital Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    All the enthusiasm pushed stock markets far beyond other yardsticks of the economy. While the Dow Jones index of blue-chip stocks climbed more than 200 percent from 1994 to 1999, personal income and U.S. gross domestic product rose less than 30 percent, and almost half that increase was from inflation; corporate profits climbed 60 percent; and the real prices of homes in 10 major U.S. cities rose a mere 9 percent, according to economist Robert J. Shiller in his book Irrational Exuberance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Then, last year, it all began to fade. It was as if investors came out of a spell and realized all those technology companies were great at soaking up money but lousy at making any. Stock prices deflated, venture capital dried up. Dot-coms began evaporating, and the media feasted on stories of arrogant young entrepreneurs suddenly losing their jobs and their Audis and their rec-room video arcades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But it wasn't just twentysomething slacker-savants who went through the wringer. Millions of ordinary workers saw their 401(k) savings plans shrink. Some investors had to postpone retirement, or take out unexpected loans for college, or let go of their brief dreams of carefree prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob Duckwall counts himself among that last group, though it shames him to admit it. He went the whole distance: left his career for a tech job, set up an online stock-trading account and finally cast his lot with an Internet start-up company. That Rob, of all people, would wind up a reluctant emblem of the age demonstrates just how far the hype and the promise of the new-economy phenomenon penetrated our culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are products of very traditional professional orientations in our family," says Rob's mother, Sharon "Spuzzie" Duckwall. "Joe [Rob's father] is a pediatrician. My father was a banker. Joe's father was a minister. You got into the profession and you lived in the same town and you did the same thing throughout your whole career. This is just a whole new world, and such a volatile one." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    She can talk to Rob one day, she says, and he'll be fretting over whether his company will get enough funding to survive. Three days later, everything's great. "That would drive me nuts," she says. "But that seems to be the arena that you play in with this stuff." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is not an arena where the Duckwalls would have expected their son to end up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob has an older sister and a younger brother, but he was never the troubled middle child. He was the conscientious one -- well- adjusted, though something of a worrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    His mother remembers Rob waking her up in the middle of the night when he was 4 years old, demanding to know what would become of him and the other kids if something happened to his parents. On family car trips, he'd lean over the front seat to keep an eye on the gas gauge. When he began showing an interest in art as a small boy, it wasn't big, messy fingerpaints that attracted him. Rob liked detail. Watching a Redskins game on TV with his father one Sunday, Rob set out to draw the stadium -- and every seat in it. "He must have drawn 100,000 seats," Joe Duckwall remembers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In high school, with no specific career goals, Rob aimed only to succeed. He worked hard in school, played soccer, took up the guitar, acted in a few school plays, worked as a stagehand for local theaters. Rob's version of teenage rebellion was to behave himself, staying home and studying while other kids partied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He wound up in college at Wake Forest, where it didn't take many drawing classes for him to realize that art was his calling. When he told his parents, they were shocked, picturing their bookish son starving in some paint-spattered studio in a basement, probably their basement. But he was committed, and even came up with a way to make some money at it. Every June during college, Rob would set up a booth at a big arts festival in Roanoke and offer to make intricate pencil drawings of people's homes. In one weekend, he'd line up enough commissions to last him through the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    During his junior year, a professor at Wake Forest suggested that Rob's skill for detail would serve him well in a specialized field: medical illustrating. He had never heard of it, but the idea immediately sounded right. Drawing heart valves and spinal columns, laboring for weeks over minute shadings on a tendon or using carbon dust to render the glistening sheen of a pancreas -- he could get into that. Rob began researching graduate programs that very afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The next year he loaded up on science and math courses to meet the entrance requirements and applied to three of the top medical illustration programs, but got rejected by them all. As a woman from the University of Michigan helpfully explained, Rob's portfolio was simply not strong enough. He couldn't believe it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob graduated Phi Beta Kappa and at a loss for what to do next. When a friend called who was trying to make it as a singer in Nashville, urging Rob to join him there, he went. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In Nashville, Rob took two jobs: laying out advertisements at the local newspaper and drawing caricatures at Opryland. Every weekend from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., he'd put on a green Jackson 5-style uniform with a huge collar and sit at his easel at the country-music-themed amusement park. While other caricaturists might spend five minutes or less on a job, Rob sometimes took more than 30, adding details and trying to please his customers. Groups of schoolkids would come off the log flume and hand him soggy $5 bills for pictures of themselves racing cars or winning bikini contests. Executives would have him pose them at their desks, pilots at the controls of their planes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It gnawed at him. He had a degree from a good university. On his best day drawing caricatures, he cleared maybe $45. The newspaper job brought home less than $150 a week, with no benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    So Rob kept working on his art portfolio. After he'd been in Nashville nine months or so, one of the graduate programs hinted that it might be willing to reconsider his application. By the end of 1989, Rob had landed a coveted spot in the graduate medical art program at Johns Hopkins. For two years afterward, he barely slept, and had no time for outside work, but thrived on the intensity of the program. A typical exercise: Students went to the Smithsonian and gathered gypsy moths, then took three weeks to paint them in fanatical detail and still barely finished in time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When he graduated in 1991, Rob began building the stable life he had been raised to expect. He didn't have to search for work; Hopkins hired him right away in its medical art department. Rob would draw surgical procedures for doctors publishing papers or making presentations, or illustrate Hopkins-produced textbooks. He also began dating Caitlin Hughes, who had entered the medical art program just as he graduated, and they married in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Just before the wedding, Rob bought his first house, a three- bedroom cottage in Homeland, an eclectic Baltimore neighborhood filled with other young couples and families. It was at that point that he used a gift from his father that made a permanent impression: the proceeds from a mutual fund begun when Rob was a baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Joe Duckwall had done the same for each of his three children, investing a total of about $300 a month for seven years in Fidelity's Magellan fund. Rob's portion of the pot had quietly matured to nearly $35,000, enough to use as a down payment on the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was the perfect material expression of his father. Steady, uncomplaining, Joe Duckwall had set a lifelong example of the power of faithful labor. The teenage Rob would wake up on Saturday mornings to the sound of his father running the lawn mower outside -- Rob's job, but Joe Duckwall was the kind of man who saw a task and did it, no fussing. He put in long hours tending to other people's sick children, and though he watched the medical profession descend into a muddle of HMOs and liability coverage, he never once complained to his family. He always drove either a secondhand Honda or a castoff Oldsmobile, but when the kids were old enough, Joe Duckwall bought each of them a new car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    So when Rob got a cold call one day at Hopkins from a financial planner, he listened. Though he could barely afford it, Rob set up an account to transfer $50 a month from his paycheck into mutual funds. "It just made me feel like a more responsible adult to do something like that," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Roger Ford had no time for mutual funds. He was looking ahead to something new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob Duckwall met him while still a student at Hopkins, and though Roger was a year younger, he seemed older -- more driven. Roger helped run the computers for the medical art department, where illustrators were just beginning to realize that these machines could be something more than glorified typewriters. Roger worked to set up a local area network and systems for computer graphics and multimedia displays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This was a guy who had gotten a chumpy Commodore 64 computer as a kid and had immediately seen its world-changing potential. A dozen years before the Internet, Roger ran a bulletin board system from his parents' home where other enthusiasts could call in on 300-baud modems and leave messages or download files. The movie "WarGames," about a kid hacking into a government nuclear weapons computer, became his personal teenage manifesto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Now, with his board-of-directors haircut and penchant for mature- looking luxury automobiles, Roger came across as the kind of guy who knew where he was going. Rob was a little intimidated at first, but eventually began to learn from him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob had never liked computers in school, and he was highly suspicious of them when it came to his art. But with help from Roger, he quickly realized some advantages. His biggest weakness as an illustrator, for instance, was color. Pencil or pen and ink were tidy and crisp, but paints were messy. Suddenly, by scanning his drawings into the computer and then manipulating them, color was easy. Fun. He could paint and shade with utter control, and mistakes went away with a click. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The faculty was more reluctant than students to plunge into the digital world. When Rob became a staff illustrator, his youth and his experience working with Roger made him the natural choice to figure out what the new medium was all about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob expanded his skills in what would prove to be a crucial way: He learned to apply not only computers to art, but art to computers, as well. He discovered a latent ability for design, using his artist's eye to create lush multimedia displays and elegant screen setups. Software advances made programming so simple that Rob didn't have to worry much about the technical side. So here he was, a trained artist with an eye for detail and a background in science, with the skills to apply all that to a powerful new visual medium. What he needed was an outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    And along came the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After about five years in the medical art department at Hopkins, Rob transferred over to the radiology lab at the end of 1995. The lab wanted to do what everybody wanted to do at that time, set up a presence on the Internet. It had a series of continuing education programs and wanted doctors to be able to access them online. Rob's assignment was to give the site its "look." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It wasn't Gray's Anatomy, but the work was fun. He enjoyed finding creative ways to liven up the stodgy topic of medical technology while still satisfying sober-minded doctors and academics. The limitations appealed to the rebel-within-the-system side of his nature -- color inside the lines, but use unexpected colors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He stuck with it for a year. Then, one day, Roger Ford called. He had left Hopkins several years before, and after a series of stair- step career moves, was now running an advanced development outfit for Thomson Corp., a publishing conglomerate. Part of his job was to market Internet design services to Fortune 500 companies, helping them set up their first home pages on the Web. He needed someone with artistic flair to make the offerings look professional and eye- catching. He needed Rob. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At that point, after six years of working at Hopkins, Rob was making a salary of about $35,000. His raises amounted to 1, maybe 2 percent a year, and he had become frustrated at being typecast as the perpetual "kid" fresh out of the classroom. Roger would double his pay and give him an annual bonus. Rob didn't have to think about it for long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In late 1996, he set off on a new career as an Internet designer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob and Caitlin did little with the extra money beyond eating out once in a while. Caitlin, who was doing freelance medical illustration work from home, noticed one other lifestyle change: Rob was almost never around anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    His Thomson office was in Rockville. Like thousands of other young people who dove into technology companies in the 1990s, Rob discovered that what Internet workers gained in money they gave up in sleep. He got up at 5 every morning to get to work by 6:30, downing a Coke when he arrived to stay awake. For much of the year, it was dark when Rob left Baltimore and dark again when he came back home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob disliked the commute, but he was finding other rewards on the job. The memory of drawing caricatures at Opryland was still raw in his mind, and the new paycheck was a welcome salve. "Having a secure job with a good salary really made me feel good about myself," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Along those lines, Roger Ford had a talk with Rob about the mutual funds he was still faithfully contributing to every month. Dark and intense, Roger was typically direct. "What are you doing?" Rob remembers him saying, implying that Rob was wasting his time. "Let's buy some stocks." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Roger told Rob to set up an online trading account, and he gave him his first tip: Globalstar was a company that planned to set up a satellite-based telecommunications network. It was going to be hot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob took $5,000, nearly half of his savings account at the time, and plunked it on Globalstar. Driving down to his parents' cottage at Smith Mountain Lake a few days later, Rob and Caitlin let their minds roam. What if the stock went up, say, $10 -- how much would they have? What if it went up more? It was an exciting prospect for two people who hadn't even been thinking about money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At work, stocks became the dominant topic of conversation. During lunchtime, on breaks, in hallways, Rob was saturated by stock tips and speculation. There was a sense that things were changing in the world, and that money was out there to be had if you were clever and fast enough. Rob had a ticker on his computer screen and watched it throughout the day. He'd pick investments by looking at the equipment his own company was buying; there were Dell computer boxes lying around, so he bought Dell. Then he bought Apple, figuring that would protect him against any slumps in PC sales. Having both Apple and Dell, he thought, made him diversified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob even began to feel slightly different at family gatherings. His wife's brother, Darrell, had always been the big businessman in the clan, with a well-paying management job in the plastics division of General Electric. Now investing gave Rob a common topic of conversation with him. At one family gathering in 1997, Darrell offered Rob a stock tip: Buy Qualcomm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob did, the next day. Then he bought some more. Darrell bought a little, but never as much as Rob, who after several stock splits wound up with about 1,000 shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While he was having fun with this new hobby, Rob was still his father's son. He wasn't buying and selling like a day trader, he was just buying, holding on to his new stocks -- Cisco, EMC, Exodus Communications, Leap Wireless, Iomega. Pfizer and Target were his only nontech holdings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob told his dad all about it, and urged him to join the fun. If he didn't want to set up an online trading account, at least he could invest in some of these exciting new companies. Joe Duckwall listened to his son, and admired his enthusiasm, but he didn't take his advice. "I'm just not the kind that goes off on this quick-fix thing," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Meanwhile, Rob became a father himself. Logan was born in September 1998. Now there was a focus for this game with stocks: Create a childhood for Logan as secure and comfortable as his own. They were off to a good start, as Rob's portfolio seemed to be climbing nicely. Aside from the grueling commute, life was happy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On weekends, all the young families on their cul-de-sac got together for cookouts and to let the kids play. Caitlin's freelance work allowed her to spend most days with the baby, and as he got older, she mixed in play groups and nursery school. Her only real complaint was that the house was starting to seem small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Caitlin had never been as caught up in stocks as Rob, but by the end of 1999 she found herself drawn in. It was nuts, what was happening. She'd watch CNBC and some of the companies were just going up and up and up. "It was like, all we have to do is invest money and we're set. Keep earning money, then invest it, then you've got more," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nothing climbed as dramatically as Qualcomm, whose stock value, by 2000, had increased a chest-swelling 2,000 percent in a year's time. It had all been so easy, and both Rob and Caitlin were vaguely suspicious of that. But the numbers were just so big, it was blinding. "I felt bulletproof," Rob says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A pair of friends had restored a magnificent home with a swimming pool in a prestigious neighborhood in Baltimore and wanted to move on to another, bigger restoration project. The friends had joked that Rob and Caitlin should buy them out; suddenly, Rob realized he could. So he did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    His brother-in-law, Darrell, and others warned that Qualcomm wasn't going to hold its peak and that Rob was overexposed. So Rob sold about two-thirds of his Qualcomm holdings. He cleared about $90,000. Coupled with the proceeds from selling their own home, Rob and Caitlin were able to put about $200,000 in cash toward the $500,000 price of the new home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Looking back, Rob realizes that a part of him wishes his father had tried to talk him out of it. "I almost wanted him to say, 'Hey, you're nuts -- a pool? And all this debt?' He didn't. He was like, 'Well, if you think you can afford it.' " &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Not only did Rob think he could afford it, he thought he was on a serious hot streak. Early last year, around the time he was buying the house, a couple of associates asked him to join them in starting an Internet company. Rob, full of confidence, quit his job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Roland Schumann had worked next to Rob at Thomson. Having learned about programming in the Army and gotten an information systems master's degree at George Washington University, Roland had far more practical experience at computer-related work. But he marveled at Rob's artistic skills. One day he watched Rob walk outside, rummage around in an ivy bed and come back with a couple of crumpled-up leaves. Rob scanned them into the computer and transformed the images into icons -- floating on water over granite -- for activating functions on an Internet page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When Roland decided to partner with a guy he met in graduate school to start a company called SwapDrive, they asked Rob to join them as a founder. Rob's flair for design would be their secret weapon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The idea behind SwapDrive originated with Roland's friend and co- founder, Marc Wallace. Now 31, Marc had been working as a space engineer at Orbital Sciences Corp., overseeing rocket launches. Every time he went to a remote rocket range, Marc was frustrated by how hard it was to get access to big files from the computer back at work. The files were too cumbersome to attach to e-mail, so he started thinking about an alternative: Make the files accessible through the Internet. At GW, Marc and Roland -- who is eight years older -- dreamed up a business plan for a company that would serve as a &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; warehouse. Clients could pay for storage space, and then those clients' employees could simply dial into an Internet account from anywhere and retrieve files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They weren't the only ones to think of the idea. A competitor in California, Xdrive, got to market first and hit the Internet gold rush, raising more than $120 million in venture capital. But Marc and Roland were transfixed by the notion of making their own mark on the business world. "It's a relatively new thing, people our age being able to run companies," Marc says. They forged ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With Rob onboard, they were able to put a professional, attractive face on their Web site, complete with a slick animated sequence that explains their product. Every time they went to woo a client, Rob designed a SwapDrive sign-in page using the client's own logo and color scheme. As an added incentive, Rob would offer to help jazz up a client's Web site -- much as he has done with vFirm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But it was clear last spring that the start-up money just wasn't going to be there anymore. The Nasdaq index of stocks, which is heavy with technology companies, reached an all-time high of 5048.62 in March 2000 and then -- like Wile E. Coyote right after he thinks to look down -- it began to fall. In one week that April, the Nasdaq lost a quarter of its value. A year later, it stood at just over 2000. Suppliers of venture capital were no longer willing to wager huge sums on risky start-up companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There were times last year when it seemed that SwapDrive would never get enough funding or customers to stay in business. It was a vicious cycle: As venture capital and stock values withered, prospective clients had less money to spend signing up with SwapDrive, making SwapDrive more needy for the very sources of cash that were drying up. "We literally started this company at the worst possible time as it relates to investors," Roland says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SwapDrive has found only a fraction of the venture capital it expected, raising less than $5 million to date. The optimistic view is that having so little cash forced the company to make sober, realistic business plans. If they had had $50 million, Marc says, they would have spent it on marketing, and they'd probably be no better off than they are today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Instead, they've had to work harder and push their expectations farther out into the future. Roland went without pay for nine months, and all three have gotten by for extended periods on three or four hours of sleep a night. They've had to cheer one another on, at times, as spouses grow weary of the grind, as their own doubts begin to overtake them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For Rob, the stress has been unlike any he's ever known. Caitlin watches his personality knot up and untangle again almost daily. One Monday morning, Rob sits on the Metro train heading into downtown Washington to SwapDrive's offices, and his face is pale and drawn. The company's major investors have agreed to place another $1 million, but he's worried they're going to lay claim to all the technology and take SwapDrive away from its founders. He got no sleep the night before. By that evening, some of the old confidence is back in his voice. Roland talked to the investors, ironed out the misunderstandings, everything is okay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In fact, the situation at SwapDrive seems to be improving. Clients have been signing up lately, and the investors say they're satisfied with the company's progress. Marc says he expects SwapDrive to become profitable next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Whatever visions of wealth once gripped them, the founders now say that mostly they just want to be able to take care of their families. If you press them hard, Roland confesses he would like to make enough money to buy a yacht. As for Marc, a college back injury dashed his hopes of entering the astronaut program, but he hasn't given up his dream of sending himself into space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They still believe those things can happen, but they'll take longer, and no one will get there simply by investing in technology companies. Roland -- who watched Rob check the ticker 20 to 30 times a day while they were working at Thomson -- never put much into technology stocks anyway. Marc says he never invested a dollar in the tech market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In fact, among his closest friends, Rob clung the most faithfully to his new- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    economy investments. Even Roger Ford -- who left Thomson several years ago and now works as an e-business consultant with Accenture -- sold most of his pure-play Internet holdings and built a more diversified portfolio. Now married, with one son and a baby on the way, Roger lives in a large custom-built home in the Kentlands planned community in Gaithersburg. He drives an Infiniti; last fiscal quarter, he donated his Lexus to charity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With so much uncertainty weighing on him, Rob's parents worry about his health. They remind him to take a break once in a while, to take care of himself. "He's tried to put up a good front, but every now and then he'll tell us, 'I'm really stressed out,' " his father says. "We can certainly well imagine he's sitting there in that big house -- you know, I'm sure there are times everybody wonders if you did the right thing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ultimately, they have faith in their son. That's why Joe Duckwall won't tell Rob what he thinks he should do, and it's why both parents worry more about Rob's happiness than about whether he'll succeed or fail. "I just feel like, chances are, he's going to make the right decision when it comes down to it," Joe Duckwall says. Retired since 1996, with a comfortable lifestyle based on his years of careful investing and saving, he recently reminded Rob that he does have a safety net. "We assured him -- we're his parents, we're back here and we're certainly going to support him in these endeavors. But he's the one on the line making these decisions and I think he's the best one to make them." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rob doesn't trade online anymore. He still watches CNBC, of course, but not with anything like the same fervor. The stock he owns, he's just going to keep, though it has lost more than half its value since last year. Globalstar, his first big investment at roughly $15 per share, was a major casualty of last year's Nasdaq meltdown and at press time was trading for pennies a share. Qualcomm began to slide just as Rob sold the bulk of his holdings; his remaining shares have lost about half of their value since last year. Cisco, which by last year had roughly quadrupled in value since Rob bought it, has lost all that gain and is trading at about what he paid. Exodus Communications has tumbled to about a tenth of his purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    So he is left to cope with the legacy of his one big payoff: the house. Rob struggled over the winter to keep up with larger-than- expected utility bills, and the mortgage has been a constant worry. Then there is the nagging feeling that he leaped too quickly, that he let himself get carried away by a greedy euphoria that was obviously not sustainable. He and Caitlin look around at their pedigreed neighborhood and wonder what they're really getting out of it. There are no other kids for Logan to play with, no friends having cookouts on the weekends. Rob sometimes drives by their old place, with its white picket fence and basket of flowers hanging on the small front porch, and if he sees someone out in the yard he feels a twinge of envy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He consoles himself with the thought that all this change came about because he was out there swinging the bat, trying to connect with the phenomenon of his time. Other generations had the Depression, or world war, or Vietnam, or disco. He had the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If things don't go well, at least you can say, well, I tried it. At least you don't look back 20 years down the road and say, I wish I tried it," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    What he'd like now is simply to feel secure -- to know that the house payment and Logan's college are both covered. Beyond that, he still dreams of being able to work without needing the paycheck to pay bills. If that were possible, what he'd want to do is go back to his art. He'd do some freelance medical illustrating. Maybe some magazine covers. For fun, he'd like to set up his own business: making drawings of peoples' houses, and marketing them over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Greg Schneider is a reporter in The Post's Business section. He will be fielding questions and comments about this article at 1 p.m. Monday on www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>Schneider, Greg</author><abstract>His brother-in-law, [Darrell], and others warned that Qualcomm wasn't going to hold its peak and that [Rob Duckwall] was overexposed. So Rob sold about two-thirds of his Qualcomm holdings. He cleared about $90,000. Coupled with the proceeds from selling their own home, Rob and [Caitlin Hughes] were able to put about $200,000 in cash toward the $500,000 price of the new home. Roland Schumann had worked next to Rob at Thomson. Having learned about programming in the Army and gotten an information systems master's degree at George Washington University, Roland had far more practical experience at computer-related work. But he marveled at Rob's artistic skills. One day he watched Rob walk outside, rummage around in an ivy bed and come back with a couple of crumpled-up leaves. Rob scanned them into the computer and transformed the images into icons -- floating on water over granite -- for activating functions on an Internet page. With Rob onboard, they were able to put a professional, attractive face on their Web site, complete with a slick animated sequence that explains their product. Every time they went to woo a client, Rob designed a SwapDrive sign-in page using the client's own logo and color scheme.
