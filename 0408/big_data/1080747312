<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; The FX Global Call covers the main talking points from a news meeting involving DJ FX Trader editors in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other FX hot spots when warranted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Brian Baskin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. The euro's drifted a bit lower, but markets are quiet ahead of the day's biggest event: Spain releasing its 2013 budget at 8 a.m. EDT. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government is trying to cut the deficit to 4.5% of gross domestic product, from 6.3% this year, but is facing mounting protests to further spending cuts and a proposal to restrict early retirement. The budget won't resolve the standoff over whether Spain will ask for a bailout, opening the door for the European Central Bank to buy its debt. Spanish 10-year bond yields hover around 6%, reflecting growing uncertainty in the market about Spain's next move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. Worries about Spain bled over to Italy's latest bond auction, which went well, but wasn't as wildly successful as some of the debt sales immediately after the ECB announced its bond-buying plan. Yields fell from the previous auction, but so did the ratio of bids to those accepted, indicating investor enthusiasm is on the wane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. Greece is also creeping back into the picture, as officials there said they are close to an agreement with creditors on austerity measures and will then submit any deficit reduction plan to a parliamentary vote. That could set up another showdown next month, with Greece's membership in the euro potentially hanging in the balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. Brazil's central bank releases its quarterly inflation report Thursday. Policymakers are expected to nod to the fact that inflation has stubbornly remained above their forecasts, but put off any action to bring it down. Inflation is a worrying indicator for Brazil's economy, which has underperformed this year but is expected to rebound in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 5. China made another giant injection into the money market, bringing the week's tally to a record $57.9 billion. The money is mainly aimed at meeting quarter-end demand--ahead of a week-long holiday no less--but the operation gave the Australian dollar and other riskier assets in the region a boost, as investors hoped that more aggressive stimulus is on the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 6. Indonesia's central bank said it will attempt to manage the rupiah's slide, rather than try to reverse it. The rupiah's fallen 5.6% this year, complicating Bank Indonesia's efforts to control inflation and narrow the country's current account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 7. It's a &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; day in the U.S. (times in EDT): 8:30 a.m. Weekly Jobless Claims: 375,000 expected 8:30 a.m. August Durable Goods Orders: -5.6% expected 8:30 a.m. 2nd Quarter GDP: +1.7% expected 10 a.m. August Pending Home Sales: +0.5% expected 11 a.m. September Kansas City Manufacturing Index: 8 last &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Brian Baskin is assistant managing editor for the Americas at DJ FX Trader, a foreign exchange news service jointly produced by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.) &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Anonymous</author><abstract>Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government is trying to cut the deficit to 4.5% of gross domestic product, from 6.3% this year, but is facing mounting protests to further spending cuts and a proposal to restrict early retirement.</abstract><title>FX GLOBAL CALL: Our Take on the Day's Big FX News</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1080747312?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Sep 27, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1080747312</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
