<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; The Signal and the Noise &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nate Silver &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (The Penguin Press, 534 pages, $27.95) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is almost a parlor game, especially as elections approach -- not only the little matter of who will win but also: by how much? For Nate Silver, however, prediction is more than a game. It is a science, or something like a science anyway. Mr. Silver is a well-known forecaster and the founder of the New York Times political blog FiveThirtyEight.com, which accurately predicted the outcome of the last presidential election. Before he was a Times blogger, he was known as a careful analyst of (often widely unreliable) public-opinion polls and, not least, as the man who hit upon an innovative system for forecasting the performance of Major League Baseball players. In "The Signal and the Noise," he takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of the success and failure of predictions in a wide variety of fields and offers advice about how we might all improve our forecasting skill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Silver reminds us that we live in an era of "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt;," with "2.5 quintillion bytes" generated each day. But he strongly disagrees with the view that the sheer volume of data will make predicting easier. "Numbers don't speak for themselves," he notes. In fact, we imbue numbers with meaning, depending on our approach. We often find patterns that are simply random noise, and many of our predictions fail: "Unless we become aware of the biases we introduce, the returns to additional information may be minimal -- or diminishing." The trick is to extract the correct signal from the noisy data. "The signal is the truth," Mr. Silver writes. "The noise is the distraction." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first half of Mr. Silver's analysis looks closely at the success and failure of predictions in clusters of fields ranging from baseball to politics, poker to chess, epidemiology to stock markets, and hurricanes to earthquakes. We do well, for example, with weather forecasts and political predictions but very badly with earthquakes. Part of the problem is that earthquakes, unlike hurricanes, often occur without warning. Half of major earthquakes are preceded by no discernible foreshocks, and periods of increased seismic activity often never result in a major tremor -- a classic example of "noise." Mr. Silver observes that we can make helpful forecasts of future performance of baseball's position players -- relying principally on "on-base percentage" and "wins above replacement player" -- but we completely missed the 2008 financial crisis. And we have made egregious errors in predicting the spread of infectious diseases such as the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second half of his analysis, Mr. Silver suggests a number of methods by which we can improve our ability. The key, for him, is less a particular mathematical model than a temperament or "framing" idea. First, he says, it is important to avoid overconfidence, to recognize the degree of uncertainty that attends even the most careful forecasts. The best forecasts don't contain specific numerical expectations but define the future in terms of ranges (the hurricane should pass somewhere between Tampa and 350 miles west) and probabilities (there is a 70% chance of rain this evening). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, Mr. Silver urges forecasters to become Bayesians. The English mathematician Thomas Bayes used a mathematical rule to adjust a base probability number in light of new evidence. To take a canonical medical example, 1% of 40-year-old women have breast cancer: Bayes's rule tells us how to factor in new information, such as a breast-cancer screening test. Studies of such tests reveal that 80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammograms, and 9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammograms (so-called false positives). What is the probability that a woman who gets a positive mammogram will in fact have breast cancer? Most people, including many doctors, greatly overestimate the probability that the test will give an accurate diagnosis. The right answer is less than 8%. The result seems counterintuitive unless you realize that a large number of (40-year-old) women without breast cancer will get a positive reading. Ignoring the false positives that always exist with any noisy data set will lead to an inaccurate estimate of the true probability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This example and many others are neatly presented in "The Signal and the Noise." Mr. Silver's breezy style makes even the most difficult statistical material accessible. What is more, his arguments and examples are painstakingly researched -- the book has 56 pages of densely printed footnotes. That is not to say that one must always agree with Mr. Silver's conclusions, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As someone interested in financial markets, I found myself unconvinced by Mr. Silver's view that it should not be "all that challenging" to identify financial bubbles "before they burst." He suggests that the dot-com bubble that deflated in early 2000 was identifiable in advance. The price-earnings multiple for the market was enormously elevated at 44. Considerable empirical work, shown in the book, was adduced to point out that long-run (10- or 20-year) rates of return from stocks have generally been poor or negative when investors entered the market at such lofty valuation metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem is that Mr. Silver has ignored all the false positives. Earnings multiples were elevated in the early 1990s, suggesting poor stock returns. But the 1990s produced extraordinarily generous equity returns. Earnings multiples were even higher in December 1996, suggesting negative long-run rates of return. This analysis influenced Alan Greenspan's famous "irrational exuberance" speech that month. The stock market rallied sharply until March 2000. Yes, the valuation model gave an accurate bubble prediction in March 2000 but a devastatingly inaccurate one throughout much of the 1990s. Stock prices were wildly inflated in early 2000. But the efficient-market hypothesis doesn't imply that prices are always correct, as Mr. Silver asserts. Prices are always wrong. What the hypothesis asserts is that one never knows for sure if they are too high or too low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Malkiel is the author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subscribe to WSJ: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Burton G.
