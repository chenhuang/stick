<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt;   Working at Walt Disney Co.'s Internet unit wasn't much fun after the Internet economy collapsed. Disney largely shut down its ambitious portal project, Go.com, took about $900 million in charges and ultimately slashed its Internet work force by half to about 1,000 employees. To the survivors, Disney gave strict marching orders: Cut costs and eke out profits without creating glitzy new content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   That wasn't easy for a Disney creative team accustomed to riding the crest of the Internet wave. "It's like hiring Picasso and having him paint your house," says Larry Shapiro, an executive vice president with the group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Two years later, Disney's Internet team is starting to get back to the fun stuff. After more than a year's delay, Disney this fall quietly launched "Toontown," an online game in which players take on character roles to battle evil robots with pies in the face and other practical jokes. The company's ABCNews.com is selling packages of video news clips prepared by the staff of ABC News. And ESPN.com is rolling out new technology that automatically plays sports highlights on the site's home page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   So what changed? "We're getting to a critical mass in broadband," says Disney Internet Group President Steve Wadsworth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Almost unnoticed in the wake of the noisy crash of the Internet economy, the number of homes with high-speed Internet connections has quietly kept building. Today, more than 15 million American households have broadband connections through cable modems or Digital Subscriber Lines, known as DSL, offered by telephone companies. With new households signing up at a rate of 100,000 a week, the total should climb to more than 20 million by the end of the year, or nearly 19% of the 107 million U.S. households. That could finally be enough high-speed subscribers to sustain online services that require &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; pipes, such as movies on demand and complex games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Of course, this is happening too late for the scores of telecommunications companies, content providers and other businesses that went bust by misjudging the rate of broadband adoption. But many of the still-standing Web developers are beginning to view broadband as more than hype. Media companies and online services are rolling out a wide range of new music, videos, movies, games and other features suited for high-speed Internet hookups but too cumbersome for most people using slower dial-up connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   In doing so, they're setting the stage for what could be a major transformation of the Internet. Much of the new content being developed for broadband users is premised on the unproved assumption that people will be willing to pay for a wide range of entertainment on the Web. If they are, get ready for a two-tiered Internet, with the hottest content sites charging subscription fees. Cable companies, online services and phone companies already are beginning to explore the idea of offering subscriptions to packages of premium content, in the same way cable companies today sell premium channels such as HBO and Showtime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The first halting steps are already being taken. Five major movie studios in mid-November launched movielink.com, a site that sells downloads of feature films, charging $1.99 to $4.99 each. Later that month Microsoft Corp. rolled out its Xbox Live service, which allows gamers with broadband connections to compete on the Internet. Not wanting to be left behind, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online is offering a special content package to broadband subscribers. For $14.95 a month, they get a hookup to the online service complete with videos, music and other AOL content not available elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Silicon Valley venture capital firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers -- which poured millions of dollars into the Excite@Home Corp. broadband service that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001 -- are beginning to explore broadband investments again. After years on the sidelines, the firm is considering investing in sports-related broadband businesses as well as companies involved in managing the rights to stored video. John Doerr, a Kleiner Perkins partner, says the firm's renewed interest stems from the growing number of broadband hookups as well as research that indicates that people with high-speed connections spend much more time on the Internet. "There's no question that broadband enables paid-for-content business models," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   To be sure, about three-quarters of the 72 million U.S. households that are hooked up to the Internet today have slower dial-up connections. Many parts of the country have not been wired for high-speed Internet, and remote areas probably won't be for years. Many Internet users still consider the cost of monthly broadband service, about $40 to $50, to be too high, and it's far from clear that people will be willing to pay even more for the new content being developed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Many media companies, worried about how easily broadband can be used to illicitly download music and pirated movies, remain deeply ambivalent about the technology. In a bid to stamp out piracy, entertainment firms have gone to court to force broadband providers to hand over the names of subscribers who illegally distribute material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Also, most people working on broadband have vivid memories of the steep losses that can be suffered by those who get too far in front of a new technology. This time, they're showing much more reluctance to commit capital to new strategies. "Two years ago we would have been running through this process," says Steve Silva, chief technology officer of Charter Communications Inc., the country's No. 3 cable company, which has signed up more than one million broadband subscribers. "Today we're walking slower." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   But the trend clearly favors broadband. More than 75 million households now live in areas with access to broadband. While most telephone companies suffered a range of technical problems in rolling out DSL service, the broadband business has been a bonanza for the cable industry -- its biggest payoff yet from the $65 billion it sank into upgrades over the past decade. Several leading cable companies, including Comcast Corp., Cox Communications Inc. and AOL Time Warner's cable division, reported record new broadband subscribers in the third quarter. Most are continuing to expand the service into new regions and some are looking at ways to create different tiers of broadband service -- fast, faster and fastest -- which would drop the price further, at least at the bottom end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Most cable companies report operating margins of more than 40% in the broadband business. A big reason: Cable companies don't have to pay for Internet content, unlike television programming, which can be very expensive. "There are 3.3 million people sending Comcast about $45 a month without significant programming costs," says Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, the country's largest cable company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Cable companies clearly recognize that content is the key to maintaining strong broadband sales. Up to now, millions have been signing up for broadband primarily for its speed and the convenience of a connection that's always activated without a lengthy dial-up procedure. But for many others, those advantages are not enough to justify the cost. So cable companies are scrambling to figure out ways to use music, videos, graphics and other jazzy broadband content to keep the cash register ringing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   In recent months, cable companies have made dozens of deals with entertainment and news companies to showcase their high-speed content. DSL providers have made similar deals but the cable firms have an advantage: Many Internet-content providers are divisions of cable programmers that have longstanding relationships with the owners of the broadband pipes. For example, Road Runner, the broadband service run by AOL Time Warner's cable division, already has about 20 deals with the Internet divisions of such cable stalwarts as A&amp;amp;E, CNN and the Weather Channel. As part of the CNN deal, Road Runner subscribers get the network's "news pass" video-clip service free of charge, a $4.95 a month value. Other content providers are simply getting a link on the Road Runner home page. Executives at both cable companies and programmers see these as the first step toward deals where the content is packaged and sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Peter Murphy, Disney's strategic-planning chief, stresses that the move to broadband remains in its infancy. Today's typical broadband connection still isn't fast enough to allow content companies such as Disney to fully exploit their creations online. "We are 20% into the development of broadband," Mr. Murphy says. A lack of speed is still holding back some ideas, such as "MySportsCenter," which would deliver customized highlights from ESPN's "SportsCenter" program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   As the necessary broadband audience materializes, some concepts have been given the go-ahead after months on life support. Toontown -- an online game in which hundreds of players work together with Disney characters to defeat a common foe -- was originally developed by a group within Walt Disney Imagineering, the company's research and development arm. It was being jointly funded by Imagineering and the Disney Internet Group when, in January 2001, Disney made the decision to dramatically downscale its Internet efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   But the Imagineering group didn't give up on Toontown, even as layoffs cut the group to 19 staffers from 24. "We said, `OK, this isn't a product right now, this is an R&amp;amp;D project,'" says Mike Goslin, who leads the team. Imagineering took over full funding again, and launched an unadvertised beta test of the game in the summer of 2001. The feedback was strong, from both veteran gamers and kids who tried it. Yet when Disney weighed an official rollout of Toontown more than a year ago, the idea was nixed because the company "didn't feel like broadband penetration was good enough," says Mr. Wadsworth. The slow dial-up connections many families still had meant it would take 40 minutes just to download software for the game, unacceptable for the impatient kids the game targeted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Mr. Goslin's group kept pushing, putting together a thick proposal to launch the game that included a stack of positive e-mails from hard-core gamers. Finally, Disney decided early last year that broadband was becoming popular enough that it made sense to move forward. In the fall, Disney quietly launched Toontown to the public, charging $9.95 for the first month and $5.95 for each month thereafter. The idea is to work out the kinks, test the business model and roll it out with an aggressive marketing campaign in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Disney's other Web outlets have taken similar detours. Bernard Gershon, ABCNews.com senior vice president, says that after the companywide downsizing, his operation initially focused on text-oriented material for dial-up customers. Then it started adding free video news clips, which became popular with the site's increasing number of broadband users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   So the company tried to capitalize on those customers: Disney last year pulled all free video clips off ABCNews.com and launched a subscription service called ABC News On Demand. For $4.95 a month, the service offers large chunks of ABC News's daily broadcasts, repackaged and in some cases expanded. Mr. Gershon says Disney's expectations were so low that it would have been happy selling 1,000 subscriptions the first year; it has already sold several times that. Disney also hopes to strike deals to offer ABC News On Demand to other DSL and cable providers for a shared fee, and recently agreed to distribute it through Bell South's DSL package. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ESPN.com, one of the most popular sites on the Web, has aggressively embraced broadband content. That is partly because 80% of those who visit the site have high-speed connections. As a result, the site has added rich graphics and free video clips, even though such features can be frustrating for dial-up users. One feature that is being rolled out to broadband users is ESPN Motion, a new Internet technology developed by Imagineering that allows video to be imbedded in a Web page, rather than playing in a separate screen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   "This sounds terrible, but I'm not too worried about" alienating dial-up visitors, says John Skipper, an ESPN executive vice president. "I do not want to program to the lowest common denominator." &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By Peter Grant and Bruce Orwall</author><abstract>In recent months, cable companies have made dozens of deals with entertainment and news companies to showcase their high-speed content.
