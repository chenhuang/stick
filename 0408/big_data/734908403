<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Author: Shara Tibken &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK--Consumer-discretionary stocks were among the weakest performers as data showed U.S. consumer spending was flat in June and pending home sales fell again during that month, reigniting worries about the broader economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailers and other discretionary stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks on trepidation about the rate of the economy's recovery. Negative economic data and concerns about Europe's health have worried retail investors, who are anxiously looking toward results from the key back-to-school shopping season. The &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; point for the industry is July same-store sales, to be released Thursday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to worries was data showing consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth, was unchanged last month after growing a revised 0.1% in May. The May figure was originally reported as a 0.2% rise, the Commerce Department said in its monthly report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personal incomes were also flat in June as private wages and salaries fell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's Retail Index fell 1.9%, down 16% over the past three months. The S&amp;amp;P 500 slid 0.5%, down 6.8% over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the decliners was OfficeMax Inc., which dropped 13%, after cutting its 2010 sales view and projecting third-quarter sales down slightly from the previous year. The outlook also weighed on shares of Office Depot Inc., down 2.1%, and Staples Inc., down 4.4% to $19.92. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luxury retailers also took a hit, with Coach Inc. slumping 3.4%. While fiscal fourth-quarter results appeared to top estimates, Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi noted one extra week of sales provided the upside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Strip out the influence from the extra week, and Coach had an in-line quarter in spite of solid gross margin expansion, operating expense control, and 10.9 million in share repurchases," he said. He noted that margins declined sequentially for the first time in more than three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of other luxury retailers trading lower included jewelry retailer Tiffany &amp;amp; Co., and upscale department chain Saks Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Department-store operators in general slumped, including shares of J.C. Penney Co. falling 8.2% and Kohl's Corp. losing 4% . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Home builders traded lower too as the National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of used homes decreased by 2.6% to 75.7 in June. Home sales have fallen two straight months as a tax credit for buyers expired April 30, and economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would be flat in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PulteGroup Inc. fell 6.1% and KB Home lost 4%. D.R. Horton Inc. shares dropped 5.8% as investors worried about orders despite the building giant reporting it swung to a fiscal third-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Shara Tibken at shara.tibken@dowjones.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Shara Tibken &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author></author><abstract>Shares of other luxury retailers trading lower included jewelry retailer Tiffany &amp; Co., and upscale department chain Saks Inc.
