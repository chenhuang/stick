<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; It is hard to go anywhere these days and not hear businesses talking about the advent of "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" and the move of business to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We originally thought we might do a cover story on the twin trends, but soon realized the advances are permeating businesses far faster than we imagined. So we shifted gears and created this special report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our regular subscribers will probably find the format familiar; we retained our traditional news sections and features into an attempt to show how no sector is going untouched by these innovations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We also wanted to explore how the concepts are being implemented, and show this is more than some preoccupation of technologists - not that there is anything wrong with the folks in IT! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington, it turns out, is one of the focal points for the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; and cloud computing movement, and what happens here will surely inform the evolution of these concepts elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please let us know what you think of the issue, and tell us what is happening at your place of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you are a newcomer to Capital Business, consider subscribing by calling 202-334-6100 or go to washingtonpost.com/capitalbusiness/subscribe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each week we strive to provide the region's most comprehensive coverage of the local business scene, whether it involves a Fortune 500 giant or a business just starting up, and our weekly report is meant to complement our regular coverage in The Washington Post. - Dan Beyers, Editor &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author></author><abstract>Washington, it turns out, is one of the focal points for the big data and cloud computing movement, and what happens here will surely inform the evolution of these concepts elsewhere.</abstract><title>Special report: The big data issue</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1020794521?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jun 18, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1020794521</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
