<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Honeywell International Inc. said defense cuts could return the profile of the U.S. military to that seen before the terrorist attacks of September 2001. A Corporate News article on Tuesday about the company incorrectly gave the date as September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (See: "Corporate News: Honeywell Readies for Defense Cuts In New Year" -- WSJ Nov. 20, 2012) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Myanmar's capital is Naypyitaw. World News articles Monday and Tuesday about President Barack Obama's trip to Myanmar, and a front-page What's News item on Tuesday, incorrectly referred to Yangon, the former capital, as the country's seat of government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (See: "World News: Obama Makes First Visit to Myanmar --- President Says Landmark Trip is Aimed At Supporting Change, not Government " -- WSJ Nov. 19, 2012, "What's News -- World-Wide" -- WSJ Nov. 20, 2012, and "World News: Obama Challenges Myanmar on Visit --- President Calls On Government to Continue Reforms Despite Obstacles, Later Criticizes Cambodia's Record in Phnom Penh" -- WSJ Nov. 20, 2012) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the lawyers in the Houston office of Sidley Austin LLP are local hires. A Nov. 16 Global Finance article about Houston law firms incorrectly said about half were local hires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (See: "Global Finance -- Deals &amp;amp; Dealmakers: Houston Lawyers Ride New Gusher --- Energy Deals Fuel Surge in Hiring and Recruitment for Attorneys With Credentials in the Oil Patch" -- WSJ Nov. 16, 2012) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the photo accompanying an article on &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; in Monday's CEO Council report, Marcelo Claure was in the center and Tim Armstrong was on the right.
