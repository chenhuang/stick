<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG--Asian stock markets fell Friday on weak manufacturing data in China, while a stronger yen fuelled losses in Japan, erasing all of its 2012 gains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two measures of Chinese manufacturing activity were released Friday, both confirming that Asia's largest economy is slowing more quickly than expected. Stocks initially dropped on the news, before paring losses later in the session as investors digested the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The PMI data "was not great and will lend itself to more stimulus out of China," said Ben Taylor, a sales trader at CMC Markets in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro fell to another 23-month low on the data, dropping to $1.2324, after losing 6.6% in May, before pulling back to $1.2349. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currencies across Asia fell on the news, though they quickly stabilized as investors geared themselves up for the next &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; point - U.S. non-farm payroll figures out after the close of trading in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Australian dollar slipped to an eight-month against the dollar before snapping back to 0.9682, while the Singaporean dollar dropped to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since January at $1.2911. Singapore's currency climbed back to $1.2878 later in the afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official China purchasing managers index fell to 50.4, down from 53.3 in April and lower than a forecast 51.5, pointing to a slowdown in activity. HSBC's competing measure came out at 48.4 in May, a contraction for the seventh straight month, from 49.3 in April. A score below fifty suggests decreasing activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market might take it as a negative, as a type of evidence that China is slowing down. But we think it is due to seasonal factors," said Bertram Lai, head of research Hong Kong and China, CIMB Securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In every month of 2012 so far, the two different PMIs have been on different sides of the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, according to research by Capital Economics. The research consultancy also pointed out that the official measure exhibits a strong seasonal pattern and has more large firms in its coverage. The HSBC measure, it says, lacks these issues and is a more representative measure of Chinese manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nikkei was one of the region's worst performers closing on Friday at 8440.25, a 1.2% drop that erased all of the index's gains for 2012. Exporters struggled with a strengthening yen: the dollar lost 1% against the yen overnight, firming up in Asian trading to 78.49. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rising yen prompted Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi to make strong hints that he would order an intervention in the market if the currency's "excessive" and "speculation-driven" moves continue, he said. The yen still has some way to go before it hits an all-time high of 75.31 reached last year, a level that provoked the government to undertake its largest-ever single-day intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A stronger local currency put Japanese exporters under pressure: Panasonic fell 2.3%, Nissan Motor fell 3% and construction equipment manufacturer Komatsu fell 4.3%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia's S&amp;amp;P ASX 200 fell by 0.3% to 4063.90, and South Korea's Kospi swooned 0.5% to 1834.51. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was at 18558.34, a 0.4% drop, and the China Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 2373.44. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of oil fell 17.5% in May, falling 1.5% overnight to $86.53 a barrel, a fresh 52-week settlement low for 2012. It was trading at $85.96 a barrel in Asia, a 0.6% decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The low cost of crude helped airlines advance in Hong Kong, as fuel costs are a large chunk of a carrier's operating costs. China Southern Airlines was the best performing airline stock, up 4.8%; while Cathay Pacific Airways was the Hang Seng's best performer, climbing 4.2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Daniel Inman at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Daniel Inman &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Inman, Daniel</author><abstract>Currencies across Asia fell on the news, though they quickly stabilized as investors geared themselves up for the next big data point - U.S. non-farm payroll figures out after the close of trading in Asia.</abstract><title>Asian Markets, Euro Slide on Weak China PMI</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1017916177?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Jun 1, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1017916177</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
