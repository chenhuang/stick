<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; FORGET about a company's fundamentals, its price-to-earnings ratio and its dividend yield. How much will it be worth to a potential acquirer? Can it use its expertise in data processing to create a new line of business? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the the Dow Jones industrial average above 9,000, investors increasingly have trouble finding stocks that look attractive by traditional benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So more and more, they are looking for intangible assets to make stock choices. They may try to gauge the unexploited potential of a brand name, from Coca-Cola to Playboy. They may look at the potential of a company to apply its core business to a seemingly unrelated one, say by taking data from a credit card business and using it to reach customers by phone. And in a world of corporate mergers, they may estimate what another is willing to pay for a company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ''We're dealing with stocks that are fully or overvalued,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist and a member of the investment committee at Legg Mason Wood Walker. ''In this environment, I would lean toward companies that are more disposed to creating shareholder value. It's the added element that gets you to buy the stock.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At his firm, analysts are placing more importance on a company's potential value to an acquirer, Mr. Cripps said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A not-so-obvious example, he said, is Cellular Communications International. The company acquires stakes in cellular telephone companies around the world. It owns about 10 percent of a rapidly growing Italian mobile phone company, Omnitel-Pronto Italia. Mr. Cripps is betting that another big Omnitel shareholder, perhaps Bell Atlantic or Airtouch Communications, will buy Cellular Communications' stake at a nice profit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though analysts expect Cellular Communications to report a loss for 1998, the stock has risen 40 percent this year, closing yesterday at $44, up $2.125. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larry Weissman, a managing director and portfolio manager of the $4.2 billion Concert Investment Growth Fund, is also a believer in hidden value. ''You have to look for where Wall Street is not adequately valuing growth opportunities,'' he said, noting that everyone is tracking price-earnings ratios and growth projections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the promising stocks Mr. Weissman has identified is Capital One Financial, a credit card company with a &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; base. It now uses the data to create customized credit cards and market them to specific groups, he said, but it is extending that strategy to cellular phone services and could use it to sell other products as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While analysts had estimated 18 percent earnings growth for the company this year, Mr. Weissman and analysts now say that growth could be as high as 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock, which closed up $3.9375 yesterday at $96.0625, has vaulted, gaining more than 75 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though finding intangible value goes far beyond identifying a respected brand name, some portfolio managers say that a name is not a bad place to start. ''Companies that can exploit niches will survive and expand their franchise,'' said Eric Weigand, senior vice president and portfolio manager at the First Capital Group in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Name recognition will help Starbucks expand both in the United States and internationally, he said. Earlier this week, Starbucks announced a British acquisition that will help it build a European business, and its stock traded at a 52-week high yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another well-known name, Black &amp;amp; Decker, is embarking on a global revamping, which includes the sale of about $900 million in assets and the repurchase of $500 million in stock. Management will then be able to focus on the better business lines and exceed earnings forecasts, Salomon Smith Barney said in a recent research report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Dwyer, a Salomon Smith Barney stock analyst, estimates that those actions will add about 40 cents to Black &amp;amp; Decker's earnings a share, which he forecasts at $4.25 in 1999, well above the consensus estimate of $3.18 a share. Based on Mr. Dwyer's forecasts, the stock, which closed yesterday at $51.625, is worth about $70 a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ferreting out intangible assets is not without its pitfalls. Intangible value can quickly evaporate with mismanagement, economic changes or fraud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors were caught off guard recently by accounting problems at the Cendant Corporation, a marketing and franchise company with membership clubs. Formed last December by the merger of CUC International and HFS Inc., Cendant lost $14 billion of its market value overnight after announcing that accounting irregularities would reduce 1997 earnings and could hurt 1998's results, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previously, stock analysts had sung the praises of Cendant, which derived the bulk of its revenue from charging customers a membership fee and then offering them a variety of discounted services, including travel, dining, entertainment, car rentals and insurance. The seemingly successful strategy was to be applied to other businesses, such as selling books. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cendant's stock has since rebounded after the company named a new chief financial officer for its Alliance Marketing unit, where the accounting problems are being investigated, and announced another planned acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether Cendant fully recovers its lost market capitalization any time soon, the lesson is clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ''The trick is to find which intangible assets are really worth more,'' said Thomas Philips, chief investment officer of Paradigm Asset Management, ''and are not being exploited by management.'' &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times ,Â Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>King, Sharon R</author><abstract>So more and more, they are looking for intangible assets to make stock choices.
