<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; There will be a drumbeat of housing data this week leading up to the big announcement of third-quarter gross domestic product Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data are scheduled to be released on existing home sales for September. Economists forecast that sales rose 4.1 percent, a slower rate of improvement than the 7.6 percent gain in August but nonetheless suggesting a steady improvement in home sales activity from the extraordinary low levels following the end of the home buyers' tax credit in the spring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two home price indexes, the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's Case-Shiller index and the Federal Housing Finance Agency index, are expected to show a 0.2 percent decline in prices. That would be consistent with other evidence that, while housing prices aren't falling off a cliff, they are gliding downward gradually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect data on new home sales to show a 4.2 percent increase in transactions in September, after being flat in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other data points are scheduled to come out as well: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Durable goods orders are forecasted to have risen a healthy 2 percent in September, following a dip in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key measure of equipment spending by businesses, are expected to rise 0.5 percent, also reflecting steady improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; point of the week will be the Commerce Department's release of third-quarter GDP data. Analysts expect a 2 percent annual pace of growth in the July through September period, which would be a slight acceleration from the 1.7 percent growth rate in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even if the forecast proves accurate, 2 percent is not a growth rate to write home about; the U.S. economy grows a bit faster than that in the long run just because of population growth and rising productivity. And it certainly isn't fast enough to bring unemployment down anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Neil Irwin &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>Irwin, Neil</author><abstract>Economists forecast that sales rose 4.1 percent, a slower rate of improvement than the 7.6 percent gain in August but nonetheless suggesting a steady improvement in home sales activity from the extraordinary low levels following the end of the home buyers' tax credit in the spring.</abstract><title>Monday Tuesday Wednesday Friday</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/759716224?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Oct 25, 2010</pub_date><pq_doc_id>759716224</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
