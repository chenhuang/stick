<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; A TEMPORARY PASS Regulators on Thursday announced a clarification that Wall Street need not immediately comply with a new rule banning banks from trading with their own money, sending sighs of relief across the financial industry. The guidance, delivered by the Federal Reserve and other agencies, explained that under the Dodd-Frank Act, banks have two years to fully comply with the Volcker Rule.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   While the law called for a two-year compliance period until 2014, the fine print left some room for interpretation. Banks were jittery about what would happen come July 21, Day One for the rule, fearing that they would have to scramble to comply before a final rule spelled out the nitty-gritty of their obligations. BEN PROTESS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   OLIVE BRANCH ON PAY  Barclays says its executives will give up some of their bonuses if the bank fails to meet profitability goals. The bank said Robert E. Diamond Jr., left, its chief executive, and Chris Lucas, its finance director, would receive only half of their 2011 deferred stock bonus if Barclays's return on equity failed to exceed its cost of equity in the next three years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Mr. Diamond's pay has been a point of contention ever since Barclays said it produced "unacceptable" returns in 2011 but awarded its chief $10 million.

Take Splunk, an enterprise software company. Splunk went public at $17 a share and closed at $35.48, valuing it at $3.28 billion. EVELYN M. RUSLI &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   WALL STREET TWEET Sallie L.
