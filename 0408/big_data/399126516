<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Cisco Systems Inc., reacting to a spike in video and data traffic on the Internet, is introducing a new generation of hardware to help communications carriers cope with the flood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The networking-equipment giant says its new hardware took four years and $200 million to develop and offers a sixfold leap in capacity over existing products. The new router, called the ASR 9000, is capable of moving 6.4 terabytes per second of traffic, the equivalent of 250,000 digital songs or 200 feature-length movies a second, Cisco says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Routers help direct data to intended destinations over computer networks. Cisco's models will compete with products from such networking companies as Juniper Networks Inc and Redback Networks, a subsidiary of Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco, of San Jose, Calif., says the capacity increase is badly needed. Data traffic has risen rapidly as carriers serve up videos and other large data files to personal computers and celphones -- a problem expected to grow more severe as high-definition video becomes more commonplace on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth has occurred at such a rate that plans for network capacity often fall short, causing a scramble among both fixed and mobile Internet providers. Cisco projects a sixfold jump in Internet traffic between 2007 and 2012, with online video as the biggest driver of global data communications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the ASR we are attempting to future-proof the network," says Pankaj Patel, a Cisco senior vice president who helps oversee the company's service provider group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four years ago, the company introduced the CSR-1, a router capable of handling heavy traffic on long-haul networks -- &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; pipes between cities and countries. Cisco was derided by industry insiders at the time for offering such a massive capacity increase. But the CSR-1 became one of the company's strongest- performing products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco's new router has a different job. Instead of handling traffic between cities, the ASR is an "edge" router that carriers use to transfer data traffic among local networks in cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eve Griliches, an industry analyst at IDC, says routers that sit so close to Internet users have more complex chores then those sitting in central data centers. They are used to monitor billing and administer security services, and with increasing traffic loads the task becomes more complex, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because it's so much more complex and does a lot more, it may take time for customers to buy" the new router, said Ms. Griliches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Georges Antoun, chief executive of rival Redback Networks, says Cisco may find it difficult to sell the new router in the current economic environment. He says Cisco already has a suite of edge routers and asking its customers to replace them with the new model just for more capacity may be a hard sell. &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>White, Bobby</author><abstract>Cisco Systems Inc., reacting to a spike in video and data traffic on the Internet, is introducing a new generation of hardware to help communications carriers cope with the flood.</abstract><title>Corporate News: Cisco Plans Major Leap In Hardware</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/399126516?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Nov 11, 2008</pub_date><pq_doc_id>399126516</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
