Ross Perot in late 1986 by buying back his G.M. class E stock for more than $700 million, the company hoped it would be free of headaches brought on by the Dallas billionaire.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHEN the General Motors Corporation got rid of H. Ross Perot in late 1986 by buying back his G.M. class E stock for more than $700 million, the company hoped it would be free of headaches brought on by the Dallas billionaire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But last week Mr. Perot announced the formation of a new company that will compete with the Electronic Data Systems Corporation subsidiary of G.M. Moreover, the structure of the new company is such that Mr. Perot seems destined to remain painful for G.M. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot's announcement came 18 months to the day after he had agreed to refrain from competing with Electronic Data for at least 18 months. Under the agreement he is permitted to compete only on a nonprofit basis until the end of 1989. Nonetheless, Mr. Perot's new company, Perot Systems, is clearly aimed at becoming very profitable one day - a big reason some key Electronic Data people have defected to the new company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot's calling card is the concept of employee ownership. In his view, workers with a vested interest try harder to make their company succeed. Perot has invested $20 million in Perot Systems, which is all of its capital. But he is taking only 40 percent of the common stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The remaining 60 percent is reserved for employees, who may choose to cash in at some point by deciding on public ownership. (Longtime Wall Street professionals may recall Electronic Data's initial common stock offering in 1968, which fetched an astronomical 100 times earnings, making Mr. Perot the first ''paper billionaire.'') Mr. Perot's goal is for Perot Systems to be a leader in the computer services industry within a decade. Mr. Perot's specialty is running data processing operations for industry and government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perot Systems has chosen, for its first job, to tackle one of the few Western bureaucracies bigger than G.M.'s: the United States Postal Service. Mr. Perot left G.M. in a huff partly because of frustration with what he described as bureaucratic inertia. His frustration evolved into open criticism of G.M. and its chairman, Roger B. Smith, which led to the buyout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The incorporation of Perot Systems and the announcement of a Postal Service consulting contract sent shock waves through G.M. and Electronic Data, the computer services company Mr. Perot founded in 1962. Eight top Electronic Data executives immediately jumped to Perot Systems, resulting in much anguish and the changing of locks at Electronic Data. At last count the number to leave for Perot Systems had risen to 19. The company has 48,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even worse, Mr. Perot's company will probably turn into a feisty competitor for &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; processing contracts, the bread and butter of Electronic Data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; G.M.'s eagerness to rid itself of Mr. Perot caused the auto maker to negotiate extremely loose provisions covering his future competition with Electronic Data, some say, and that mistake has come back to haunt the auto maker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ''G.M. should have tied him up for at least three years,'' said Jim Rogers, a Columbia University professor of finance. Mr. Rogers suggested that G.M. try to soften the effects of its mistake by suing. Even if it loses, G.M. might be able to slow Perot Systems a bit. G.M. lawyers are re-examining the buyout of Mr. Perot to determine whether a basis for action exists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot said that for reasons of courtesy he had notified G.M. several days before the public announcement of Perot Systems that he would hire Electronic Data people. ''The last thing in the world I want to do is cause any undue stress between the two companies,'' Mr. Perot said. Accordingly, Mr. Perot has hired an attorney to, in his words, ''make sure I'm in compliance with the G.M. buyout agreement.'' Moreover, he said, he advised Perot Systems executives ''to take a broad view and to hire excellent people from places other than E.D.S.; I.B.M., for example, has some of the best people in the country.'' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Les Alberthal, Electronic Data's chairman and chief executive, said he had told Mr. Perot he was disappointed that he was becoming a competitor. ''He took the fruits of the efforts of the people of E.D.S., sold it and is using the proceeds to compete with us,'' Mr. Alberthal said, although professing no bitterness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any case, there are a lot of hard feelings. For example, an Electronic Data policy promulgated this week barred assistants of Mr. Perot from dropping by to collect his personal mail from Electronic Data headquarters in Dallas. Now, misdirected letters will be returned to the Post Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Mr. Perot, starting anew is an idealistic quest, a chance to create jobs and once more display his formula for business success. With a personal fortune of more than $2 billion, he does not need the money.   &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times ,Â Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>Levin, Doron P</author><abstract>The remaining 60 percent is reserved for employees, who may choose to cash in at some point by deciding on public ownership.
