<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; DALLAS -- The first decision billionaire H. Ross Perot must make in "retirement" is whether to stop criticizing General Motors Corp. -- something that now could get expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under terms of the agreement he and GM signed yesterday, both parties are prohibited from publicly criticizing each other. Any disputes over just what constitutes "criticism" would be decided by a panel of three arbitrators, who could levy penalties of as much as $7.5 million. Nonetheless, says a source close to Mr. Perot, "If they get him mad he'll just write the check" and continue to speak his mind. The panel would be composed of Mr. Perot's personal attorney, a GM official and a third person chosen by both parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot, who says he'll keep his commitment to address the Economic Club of Detroit Monday, certainly seemed in a mood to speak his mind yesterday. Shortly after GM announced his resignation and said it bought his GM stock for $750 million, Mr. Perot issued a statement that said: "I cannot accept this money without giving the GM directors another chance to consider this decision. This money will be held in escrow until Dec. 15 in order to give the GM directors time to review this matter and the events that led to this decision." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later at a news conference Mr. Perot said: "Is spending all this money the highest and best use of GM's capital?" He told how one EDS employee jokingly asked him whether the money was "greenmail," and then "another EDSer walked up and said it's really hushmail," referring to the provision barring criticism of GM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Perot has already violated that clause," one top-level GM source fumed yesterday. And outside director James H. Evans, chairman of the audit committee, stated that the directors have "no intention of rescinding the agreement." Mr. Perot, told of GM's anger, shot back: "I can't help that." He also, however, quipped to reporters at his news conference: "Don't ask me a question that will cost me too much money." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot's pact with GM also precludes him from waging a proxy contest against the company for five years, and from starting a business competing with EDS for three years. Asked yesterday whether he might eventually start a new company, Mr. Perot said he hasn't any current plans to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what does the 56-year-old entrepreneur do now? For starters, he says, he'll continue working at Electronic Data Systems Corp., helping the company he launched to develop new customers. His buyout agreement with GM lets him stay at EDS as "founder" as long as he wants, a role that would let him help land &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;-processing contracts for the company while allowing others to handle daily management and policy issues. That, says Mr. Perot, has been his role at EDS anyway for the last couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those who know Mr. Perot say that despite his affection for EDS, he isn't likely to be satisfied with a figurehead role and will certainly seek new mountains to climb. Managing the family holdings with his son, Ross Jr., could be a full-time job in itself. Mr. Perot, who is listed by Forbes magazine as the second wealthiest American, presides with his son over a real estate, oil and gas and investment empire valued at $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, he's already deeply involved with investigating whether U.S. soldiers listed as Missing In Action in Southeast Asia could still be alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot says he believes that an unknown number of U.S. prisoners of war are still alive in Southeast Asia, and in recent months he has visited Washington to argue for a concerted new effort on the issue. A spokesman for Vice President George Bush said last month that the Reagan administration has asked Mr. Perot to help resolve the longstanding MIA issue. Mr. Perot recently spent considerable time inside the Pentagon, quizzing Defense Intelligence Agency officials assigned to analyze live-sighting reports of prisoners of war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A former Navy officer, Mr. Perot maintains a deep interest in military affairs that is reflected in the decor of his office. On one wall is a Norman Rockwell painting titled "Homecoming"; it depicts a Marine returning from World War II and holding a Japanese flag. Nearby is a picture of 28-year-old Ross Jr. standing next to the fighter plane he pilots for the National Guard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot, who also has four daughters, is extremely close to his son, and has given him wide leeway to manage family business affairs. Father and son recently have taken intense interest in a small investment that could ultimately put them in direct competition against the one American who reputedly has more money than them -- Sam Walton, founder and chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Perots have invested in American Wholesale Club, a warehouse retailer that sells a wide array of household goods at near-wholesale prices. Wal-Mart has opened several similar outlets called Sam's, including one directly across the street from American Wholesale's first and only store near Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot says that all the family's oil and gas interests are domestic, onshore and in shallow wells. "If it's shallow, we'll find it," he said in an interview yesterday. He said that despite the slide in energy prices, the family's energy interests are doing well because they had earlier negotiated many long-term, fixed-price contracts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for real estate, "we believe in raw land in the path of growth and in developing communities," he said. Thus, the family has bought some 13,000 acres of land west of the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, which Mr. Perot and his son believe will become a major area for development. "The stockyard used to be south of this land and the wind blew the smell north, maybe that's why no one moved there," Mr. Perot said. "There's no stockyard any more." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The family also has 1,000 acres near Sherman, Texas, and owns building projects in Atlanta, Richmond, Va., and Kansas City, Kan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third leg of the family company is securities investments, which are handled out of a small office on the top floor of EDS headquarters. Mr. Perot leases the space from EDS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extensive holdings are a far cry from what Mr. Perot started with in 1962. Back then he quit his job as a salesman for International Business Machines Corp. and launched EDS with $1,000, because he believed that data-processing services ultimately had more growth potential than computer hardware. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Perot's success against long odds made him scoff at U.S. auto makers' oftsounded complaint that they hadn't had a "level playing field" on which to compete against the Japanese. His own playing field when he started EDS, Mr. Perot has said, "was like a cliff . . . . Brains and wits will beat capital all the time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>By Doron P.
