<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; At the start of this year we invited our panel of European technology thought leaders to put their reputations on the line by making predictions about what would happen in technology this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's hard to make predictions--especially about the future," is one of those oft-quoted quotations, variously ascribed to physicist Niels Bohr, Danish artist Robert Storm Petersen, Sam Goldwyn, and baseball-playing philosopher Yogi Berra. Our panelists might well agree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each of our panel of thought leaders was asked to make three predictions. One was low risk--something they thought would almost certainly happen. For the second prediction, they were invited to go out a bit on a limb. Finally they were invited to throw caution to the wind and make some left-field prediction. So how did they do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the low-risk category cloud computing and the continuing growth of mobile were the two most frequent predictions by pretty well all respondents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both were good calls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take cloud computing--the idea that companies will shift data and applications to remote servers, increasing flexibility and reducing cost. This market has grown dramatically. According to a report by analysts Gartner Inc., the public cloud services market is forecast to grow 19.6 % in 2012 to total $109 billion world-wide. Analysts IDC predicted that from 2012-2016 public IT cloud services will enjoy a compound annual growth rate of 26.4%, some five times the growth of the IT industry overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, as market penetration increases, growth rates are slowing. IDC estimates that the world-wide mobile phone market will grow 1.4% year on year in 2012, the lowest annual growth rate in three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, that masks the explosion in the smartphone sector, which, the company says, has seen smartphone shipments grow by 45.1% year on year to 717.5 million units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within that mobile prediction were some specific predictions. Ilja Laurs, chief executive of GetJar Inc., suggested that Android, Google Inc.'s mobile operating system, would eclipse Apple Inc.'s iOS in 2012 as the platform of choice for developers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Android has established itself as the largest smartphone operating system, accounting for, by the third quarter of this year, 75% of shipment volumes of smartphones. However, does that mean it has become the platform of choice? That proves to be rather harder to establish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another IDC report found that 89% of developers were "very interested" in developing for the iPhone and 86% for the iPad, higher than on other devices, which would suggest not. On the other hand, a report by GigaOM in October found that the Android developer market is growing at least twice as quickly as the Apple market. On balance we can't give that to Mr. Laurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there is the place of Windows Phone, Microsoft's horse in the smartphone race, and championed by Nokia. Mr. Laurs predicted that for 2012 "Nokia finally starts shipping significant [Windows Phone] volumes," while Oliver Bussmann, chief information officer of SAP AG, was a lot more circumspect. While Nokia has achieved substantial progress over the year in terms of developing and shipping products it would be generous to describe it as making significant volumes. This month it was reported that Samsung had replaced Nokia at the top of the table for total handsets shipped, according to IHS iSuppli Mobile and Wireless Communications Service. We will call that for Mr. Bussmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkcell Chief Executive Officer SÃ¼reyya Ciliv was bullish about the transformation of mobile devices into electronic wallets. While his company has been doing some interesting work in Turkey, the whole sector is awash with a bewildering array of rival products from network operators, card providers and other payment providers. A mobile wallet is a gold mine of consumer data, a trifecta of payments, retail and advertising. However, adoption outside of Turkey has been slow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jass Sarai, U.K. technology leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Ben Verwaayen, CEO of Alcatel-Lucent, both look good by expressing caution over the uptake of the next generation of mobile technology in Europe this year. While LTE, which promises much faster speeds over existing 3G, has been growing steadily in Europe it has yet to make significant impact. According to Wireless Intelligence while there were 27 million LTE subscribers globally in the second quarter of 2012, only 6% were in Europe compared with 47% in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft International President Jean-Philippe Courtois put the impact of &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; on health care in his medium-risk predictions. &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big data&lt;/span&gt; continues to promise much, especially in the world of health care, but actual evidence is rather harder to come by. The U.K., because of its cradle-to-grave health care system, is well placed to make the first moves. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink launched in early 2012. It will see anonymized data from all NHS registered patients available under controlled circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Verwaayen takes credit for the most outrageous pair of predictions. His "chancing your luck" category included: "Goal-line technology will be implemented by FIFA" and "Arsenal to win a trophy of some sort." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He comes out looking not too bad. FIFA President Sepp Blatter said just this month that goal-line technology will be used at the 2014 World Cup, so he can claim that one. But as for Arsenal ending its silverware drought, the Premier League team suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Bradford City, a team three divisions lower in the English football league. So #fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Ben Rooney &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Rooney, Ben</author><abstract></abstract><title>Predicting the Tech Future is a Difficult Thing to Do</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1240579918?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Dec 19, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1240579918</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
