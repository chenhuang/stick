<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; [The technology executives at last week's CIO Network conference divided into five task forces to debate their management and and policy agendas in the following areas. Here are their top recommendations.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GETTING AHEAD OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. CREATING A CULTURE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs should create a cultural appetite that accepts change, risks and failure, and understands that innovation can take time. Invite venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to talk to senior leadership and identify ways your business is going to be disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. MAKING THE CALL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Accept that managing innovation requires living in a gray area between art and science. Don't follow your gut or the rules. Follow the odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. PARTITION DISRUPTION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Name the disruption and then partition it as a separate business with separate financials, people and metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. KEEP HEAD OUT OF SAND &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Identify and accept inevitabilities and work them into your strategy. Create an unassailable argument around the inevitable to gain acceptance in the organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CO-CHAIRS: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celso Guiotoko, Corporate Vice President and CIO, Nissan Motor Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Singer, Head of Global Business Services, Information Systems and Technology, Managing Director -- Singapore, Rio Tinto PLC &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eash Sundaram, Executive Vice President and CIO, JetBlue Airways Corp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUBJECT EXPERT: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael E. Raynor &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director, Deloitte Consulting LLP &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW CIOS CAN CREATE A TECH-SAVVY ORGANIZATION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. SOFT SKILLS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strengthen your personal attributes that make the difference in building relationships with executive partners and succeeding as an IT leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. EMBRACE AGILITY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs should embrace "agile" techniques and management principles to be flexible, interactive and iterative. This helps increase transparency and, by sharing both pain and success with business units, deliver massive amounts of change that are increasingly needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. LEAD BY LETTING GO &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Align your organization with business units to help other executives understand the contribution IT can make in designing and implementing new strategic initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. CROSS-POLLINATION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cross-pollinate teams for better collaboration. Share expertise and investment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CO-CHAIRS: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annabelle Bexiga, Senior Managing Director and CIO, TIAA-CREF &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy Krotowski, Vice President and CIO, Caterpillar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUBJECT EXPERT: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arthur M. Langer, Academic Director, Executive Masters in Technology Management, Columbia University &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW THE CIO CAN BECOME A CORPORATE STRATEGIST &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. HARD-WIRE TO THE BUSINESS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs should be customer-focused and knowledgeable about the business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. DRIVE INNOVATION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Create "skunk works" teams, small groups that are able to operate with minimal management constraint. Be the keeper of the forward view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. INFLUENCE WITH IMPACT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIOs must be able to effectively communicate. And they must understand the context of their organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. CHANGE THE CIO MINDSET &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be an activist. Have functional excellence, but don't make that everything you are. Free yourself from the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CO-CHAIRS: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramon Baez, Senior Vice President and CIO, Hewlett-Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Catherine P.

Spitze, Executive Director, Fisher CIO Leadership Program, Institute for Business Innovation, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHAT WASHINGTON CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. IMPROVE SCHOOLING &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Policy makers should rethink K-12 education, better exploiting technology and &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;, focusing on sciences and fitness at young ages, providing incentives for good teaching and using existing budgets more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. TAX REFORM &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Change tax code to incentivize domestic innovation and investment and encourage permanent repatriation of profits for U.S. investment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. REMAKE HIGHER EDUCATION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Use technology to create faster, lower-cost graduate degrees in sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. LIGHT TOUCH &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government should provide incentives for investment in innovation and opportunities for all citizens, and then get out of the way -- refrain from picking winners and losers, and reduce regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CO-CHAIR: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Donovan, Senior Executive Vice President, Technology and Network Operations, AT&amp;amp;T Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUBJECT EXPERT: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nariman Behravesh, Chief Economist, IHS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATTRACTING AND RETAINING GREAT TALENT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. PLAY TO WIN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Create a culture that fosters a business-value mind-set. Hire people with the courage to be irreverent. Show employees how they connect to the overall business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2. GO BROAD &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hire people with a diversity of backgrounds and experiences, beyond classic IT. Provide access to other parts of the organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. TELL THE STORY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get people excited about the mission of the organization. Convince them they are on a winning team. Sell yourselves and what you do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4. GO DEEP WITH SCHOOLS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deepen relationships with colleges and universities as well as other strategic partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CO-CHAIRS: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie Bird, Managing Director and CIO, Carlyle Group &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brenda R.
