The Compaq Computer Corporation is planning to roll out a significant new PC in three weeks. Several major software companies are finally getting ready to put the shrink wrap on new programs written for the OS/2 operating system. In short, June is shaping up as a busy month for the PC market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ''How quaint,'' hundreds of thousands of Macintosh users must be saying. For them, the PC is a curious relic of a long-forgotten time before humans were enlightened on the finer points of personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may be. It is clear that the PC makers are envious of the Mac's technology, since they are going to great expense and trouble trying to make PC's look and work more like Macs. (The new DOS version 4.0 is expected to use a graphical user interface, the buzzword that describes a Mac-like system.) But while PC's move toward Macs, Macs are moving down the evolutionary path as well. Apple is reportedly preparing its portable Mac, code-named Laguna, and two new versions of the Macintosh II for delivery in late fall or early winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, there is a lot of action in the Macintosh word-processing arena. Several new or improved programs are finally reaching the market and a couple of others are in the final draft stage. Why, one could write a soap opera about all the plot twists in Apple word processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Mac word processor was MacWrite, and if you bought a Mac you got MacWrite whether you wanted it or not. Then Apple stopped including MacWrite free and formed a separate company called the Claris Corporation that is responsible for developing and selling software. Claris promptly improved MacWrite to version 5.0, giving it a host of new features, including a spelling checker and some keyboard shortcuts. At $125, it is the best-selling entry-level word processing program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people insist that MacWrite was not the original choice for a Mac word processing package; that Steve Jobs, then Apple's chairman, favored a program called WriteNow. The Mac version of WriteNow ($175) is sold by the T/Maker Company of Mountain View, Calif., and in general it's an excellent choice for people who want a simple, easy word processor with a bit more power than MacWrite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Jobs left Apple to start his own company, NeXT, which is preparing to unveil its long-expected scientific and education computer in June. Once again, Mr. Jobs is favoring WriteNow as the word processor of choice for his new computer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As soon as MacWrite was unbundled from the Mac, users started switching in droves to Microsoft Word. Tonight, Microsoft is expected to announce a new version of word, 4.0, scheduled for fall delivery, that will offer faster speed and true wysiwyg, pronounced wizzy-wig, for ''what you see is what you get''; in other words, you'll be able to see on the screen exactly what the page will look like before you send it to the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, not everyone needs all of the powerful features of Word. So Microsoft has a stripped-down version for the Mac called Microsoft Write ($175). It is easier than Word but uses the same command structure and has a painless upgrade policy designed to make it logical to move up to Word if the user outgrows Write. For writers who think they may eventually need more power, but who want to start slow and easy, this warrants a close look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Macintosh owners who were eager for a full-featured word processor sent in their money for a package called FullWrite Professional many moons ago. In the interim Ann Arbor Software sold FullWrite to Ashton-Tate, the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; base company in the PC realm. Finally, more than a year after some people sent in their checks, the first copies of FullWrite are just now going out the door. The high end of the word processing market is shaping up as a battle between Word 4.0 and FullWrite Professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also long overdue was the Macintosh version of WordPerfect, the most popular word processing program for PC's and destined to be a hit among Mac users. WordPerfect started selling ''beta'' versions of the product in January, bugs and all, in essence getting customers to pay for the chance to discover any glitches. The final version is available at last at $395. My, how the phone lines have been burning up to WordPerfect's headquarters in Orem, Utah. Critics say the calls are to the customer support line; supporters say they are to the order line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But wait - there is one more major challenger. Spies report that there will be a Macintosh word processing program coming late this summer from MicroPro, the people who introduced WordStar to the PC market. WordStar used to be the overwhelming favorite among PC users but fell from grace when it failed to keep up with the advances made by competitors such as WordPerfect. MicroPro's president, Leon Williams, has revitalized WordStar; the next version is a definite improvement; but his heart reportedly belongs to the Mac. ''I've used a Mac every day since early 1984,'' he confided.   &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>New York Times ,Â Late Edition (East Coast)</pub_title><author>Lewis, Peter H</author><abstract>That may be.
