<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; This Journal Report doesn't stop here. As part of an expanded Web presence for the Journal Reports, we're launching The Experts -- an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who will engage in in-depth online discussions of topics raised in this and future Reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the latest discussion, we have gathered experts to weigh in on a host of leadership issues, including &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;. The experts on this topic include Bob Kerrey, former U.S. senator from Nebraska; Rosabeth Kanter, the Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School; and Dominic Barton, chief executive of McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'll talk about the benefits and risks of the mountains of data companies can now summon up, how leaders can spur innovation at their organizations, the government's role in encouraging innovation, and the merits of hiring superstar CEOs from outside the company versus promoting from within. To read what The Experts have to say, visit WSJ.com/LeadershipReport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Experts also will engage in occasional video discussions of leadership and other topics, to which readers can submit questions at TheExperts@WSJ.com. The next video discussion will be a live Spreecast on Monday, March 11, at 3 p.m. Eastern time with Ms. Kanter; Kim Campbell, Canada's first female prime minister; and Eric Spiegel, president and CEO of Siemens Corp. You can watch this video live, or later at your convenience, at WSJ.com/LeadershipReport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subscribe to WSJ: &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal ,Â Eastern edition</pub_title><author>Anonymous</author><abstract>The experts on this topic include Bob Kerrey, former U.S. senator from Nebraska; Rosabeth Kanter, the Ernest L.
