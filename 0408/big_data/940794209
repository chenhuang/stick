<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Chevy Chase-based private-equity firm Arlington Capital Partners is merging one of the companies it has invested in with a new acquisition to build a new "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" contractor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal brings together two local businesses, Tysons Corner-based White Oak Technologies, which Arlington Capital Partners bought a majority stake in late 2010, and Reston-based FGM. Arlington Capital would not disclose the terms of the deal, but it will own a majority stake in the new entity and the rest of the company will be owned by White Oak and FGM's founders and management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter LaMontagne, a CACI International executive who has also worked at Paradigm Technologies and ManTech International, will head the merged company, which will be called Novetta Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new company will maintain leadership from its predecessors; Alan Broder, White Oak's chief executive, has been appointed chairman, while Scott Gessay, FGM's chief executive, has been made president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both companies have expertise in large data sets and work with national security customers, LaMontagne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The two companies have very similar cultures," he added. "This is not one large company acquiring the other, but two complementary companies coming together to form something new." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merger comes as mid-size contractors gain clout within the industry. Though traditionally known as a difficult size - too big to receive special treatment reserved for small businesses and too small to have the scale and brand name of major contractors - the size has won more fans in a difficult federal spending environment. Analysts say these companies are typically more agile and don't have the significant overhead costs of larger firms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LaMontagne said he expects both White Oak and FGM to receive a boost from the merger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's no doubt that having a little bit more scale will ... give us a little bit more reach," he said. "At the size that we are, we still have a long way to grow and still maintain that agility." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private-equity firms like Arlington Capital have taken an increased interest in contracting firms in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This deal is "private equity aggressively building a platform business," said Bob Kipps, managing director of the McLean-based investment firm KippsDeSanto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; censerm@washpost.com &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>Censer, Marjorie</author><abstract>Arlington Capital would not disclose the terms of the deal, but it will own a majority stake in the new entity and the rest of the company will be owned by White Oak and FGM's founders and management.</abstract><title>Private-equity firm merges two local contractors</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/940794209?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Mar 26, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>940794209</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
