<DOCUMENT><publisher>New York Times Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Some companies -- most notably Dell -- choose to go direct, while others have directness thrust upon them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Seagate, the world's largest maker of hard drives, right, has started selling products directly to large customers in higher volumes than ever before because more companies with &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; centers are trying to cut costs. "We are seeing more and more of the direct purchases from companies with huge data sets," said Stephen Luczo, the chief executive of Seagate, in a recent interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Google is famous for mastering this method. Part of its mystique has come from the secretive ways it buys chips, motherboards, memory and drives directly from the major suppliers, and builds its own servers for its immense data centers. Google has essentially cut out the middleman -- in this case, the likes of Hewlett-Packard, Dell and I.B.M. -- to gain a competitive edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   "The guys like Amazon, eBay and Yahoo -- all those guys have bought direct," Mr. Luczo said. "And it's bleeding now into investment banks and other verticals." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The increase in direct purchases underscores a couple of shifts in the hardware industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   For one, the hardware behemoths like H.P. and Dell end up competing with their traditional suppliers, like Intel and Seagate, for big volume business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Second, we're seeing what happens as large companies struggle to satisfy their insatiable demand for computing horsepower. More companies appear willing to get down and dirty by meddling with their own systems rather than buying prepackaged goods from the large computer makers. ASHLEE VANCE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   COMMENTIf Dell, H.P., I.B.M., etc. are not adding significant value, then they shouldn't get that business. Even a large investment bank is not going to buy enough hard drives or other components to get a price as low as Dell is. It's up to Dell then to combine these cheaper components and provide hardware and service that would cost an investment bank more to do in-house.
