<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Tuesday, April 24, 2012 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overseas Students Eye Canadian M.B.A.s, Job Opportunities &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody says job-hunting is easy, especially these days, but it may be toughest for international job applicants seeking positions in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With local talent plentiful,. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it might be a little less painful for international job seekers in Canada, after that country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent numbers from the Graduate Management Admission Council, which administers the GMAT, show that Canadian M.B.A. programs are seeing an uptick in interest.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At McGill University's Desautels Faculty of Management, international applications comprised 50% of all applications in 2011, up from about 35% in 2007. Including permanent residents, who recently moved to Canada to claim resident status in Quebec, the proportion of the M.B.A. class has jumped to around 65% in 2011 from 50% before the regulatory change took effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; York University's Schulich School of Business has seen international applications to its full-time M.B.A. increase 86% in the last three years, and more than double in the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Students are voting with their feet and their pocket," says Jeff Muzzerall, director of the corporate connections center at University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management and a champion of the regulatory change. "Our arms are wide open." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At that school, 42% of the class graduating this spring comes from abroad -- up from 38% for the class of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday, April 23, 2012 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYU Stern Sees Big Opportunity in &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York University Stern School of Business is creating a one-year master's degree in business analytics. It's among the highest profile schools to launch such a program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Classes are scheduled to begin in May 2013, with students expected to attend "modules" at NYU's New York and Shanghai campuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for one-year graduate degrees in business analytics is growing crowded. The business schools of Drexel University, University of Connecticut, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, University College Dublin and others already offer master's in analytics, taking advantage of industry concerns over an ever-increasing amount of data on customer preferences, marketing programs and operations, which most employees can't make heads or tails of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYU hopes to differentiate its program by targeting adults with at least 10 years of professional experience, rather than newly-minted undergraduates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ideal students include mid-level managers with analytical expertise, as well as general managers seeking to gain technical skills, said Stern Dean Peter Henry. "Business leaders of the future have to be integrated thinkers" as infrastructure projects and technology grow more complex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the school's decision to offer the course in Shanghai, Mr. Henry said, "our desire is to meet the market where it is." Chinese students have become keen on one-year programs, with large numbers flocking in particular to those that don't require prior work experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analytics degree will cost $63,500, on par with the school's other specialized master's programs. Stern expects an inaugural class of around 30, ultimately growing to 60. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday, April 11, 2012 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New Dean at Penn State's Smeal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn State University's Smeal College of Business has named Charles H. Whiteman as its new dean, capping a nearly two-year search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Whiteman, whose appointment must still be approved by the school's board of trustees, will succeed Jim Thomas. Mr. Thomas, dean at Smeal since 2006 and a strategic management professor, announced in 2010 he would step down to return to the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Whiteman, an economist, currently serves as senior associate dean for the Tippie College of Business at University of Iowa, overseeing undergraduate and graduate degree programs, faculty and staff recruitment, budget and strategic planning, among other functions. Mr. Whiteman also serves as interim director for the Institute for Economic Research at Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes less than a month after Tippie announced Sarah Gardial would take that school's deanship in July. Mr. Whiteman said he began looking into several options last fall, and his interest in Penn State predated the Iowa changes by several months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuesday, April 10, 2012 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; B-Schools Draw Asian Applicants &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business schools worldwide continue to draw thousands of applicants from Asia, with the numbers swelling particularly among women and young adults from China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year a record-high 85,551 Asians sat for the Graduate Management Admission Test, a common entrance exam for graduate business programs. That's up 47% from the 2007 testing year, thanks in large part to increasing interest from Chinese citizens. That group took 40,069 of those exams last year, nearly triple the 2007 figure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women comprised 64% of Chinese GMAT test-takers, well above the 47% average across all Asians. Chinese test-takers were also significantly younger than their counterparts in the rest of Asia: 77% were under age 25, while just over half of all Asian test-takers were in that age group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of the gain among those sub-groups is due to an increasing interest in so-called "pre-experience" master's programs, which students enroll in straight out of college, before going into the workplace. Such degree programs are increasingly popular among young adults seeking to gain an edge in a tight job market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the GMAT's popularity soared among Chinese in the past five years and increased in India as well (25,394 test-takers in 2011, compared with 21,481 in 2007), test-taking activity declined among individuals hailing from countries including South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is due in part to population declines in countries such as Japan and South Korea, as well as currency fluctuation pushing overseas school tuition out of reach for some, said Alex Chisholm, senior manager of statistical analysis at GMAC. Some of those countries, especially Japan and South Korea also have been slower to warm to the specialized master's programs in finance, accounting and management, sticking instead to traditional M.B.A.s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. remains a top destination for Asian business-school applicants, with citizens from the region sending 69% of their GMAT scores to U.S. business programs. But schools in other regions are gaining steam: Asian schools captured 6% of all scores last year. In 2007, U.S. programs captured 74% of all test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friday, March 23, 2012 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haas, Columbia to Part Ways on Joint E.M.B.A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decade-old, when the current class graduates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rich Lyons, dean at the Haas School and Glenn Hubbard, dean at Columbia Business School, said the decision was made jointly and reflects growing differences in each school's goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haas plans to launch a stand-alone executive M.B.A. in 2013, alongside its existing full- and part-time M.B.A.s. The school introduced a new curriculum two years ago, and Mr. Lyons said it was difficult to incorporate the changes into the Berkeley-Columbia program. "It was evolving more slowly than our other programs," Mr. Lyons said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Mr. Hubbard said in a separate interview that "even in joint programs, it's quite easy to introduce curriculum innovations." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Columbia, which offers other executive M.B.A.s in partnership with London Business School and University of Hong Kong School of Business, as well as its own New York-based executive program that meets on weekends. Mr. Hubbard said the school is also looking at ways to reach more audiences elsewhere around the U.S. and in South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Columbia and Haas had already begun accepting students for the class that was slated to begin in May. Those students will be invited to enter any of Columbia's existing executive M.B.A. programs, enroll in Haas's evening and weekend M.B.A. or wait until Haas launches its own executive M.B.A. in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We recently reached the conclusion that our goals and visions for the future of the partnership were no longer aligned, and we needed to act now," Haas's Mr. Lyons wrote in a letter to the school community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 19-month program graduated more than 600 students since launching in May 2002. Students in the course meet in California 18 times and New York another seven, with sessions roughly every three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday, March 22, 2012 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Babson Brings Entrepreneurship Degrees to Indian Start-Up University &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Babson College is partnering with a fledgling Indian university to launch three new degrees in entrepreneurship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shiv Nadar University, which was founded in 2011 and currently does not have a business school will receive assistance from Babson in developing its curriculum, training faculty and establishing a center for entrepreneurship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Babson will receive an as-yet-undetermined fee for its consulting services. Shiv Nadar also has gifted $600,000 to join the Babson-run Global Consortium for Entrepreneurship Education, through which Babson which offers a number of schools curriculum design, faculty training and guidance on establishing entrepreneurship centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning in fall 2013, Shiv Nadar - based in India's National Capital Region - plans to offer students a four-year undergraduate business degree, a two-year M.B.A. and a one-year Master's in Entrepreneurship. Bachelor's and M.B.A. students will study in India but have the option to spend part of their course at Babson; the one-year Master's students will be required to travel to Babson, which is based near Boston. Students will receive degrees from Shiv Nadar, as well as certificates from Babson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Len Schlesinger, Babson's president, Shiv Nadar administrators contacted Babson a few years ago to begin discussing a potential relationship. Though there's some reputational risk involved in a tie-up with such a young school, Mr. Schlesinger said Babson isn't interested in partnerships with long-established institutions. "We have a preference to be able to design from scratch," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shiv Nadar University was launched by the namesake charitable foundation of Shiv Nadar, founder and chairman of HCL, an Indian information-technology company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write to Melissa Korn at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Melissa Korn &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Korn, Melissa</author><abstract>The business schools of Drexel University, University of Connecticut, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, University College Dublin and others already offer master's in analytics, taking advantage of industry concerns over an ever-increasing amount of data on customer preferences, marketing programs and operations, which most employees can't make heads or tails of.</abstract><title>What's News from B-Schools</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1009069527?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Apr 24, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1009069527</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
