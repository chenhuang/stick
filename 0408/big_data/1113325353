<DOCUMENT><publisher>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; Some stores send expectant mothers gift packages containing a few diapers, some bibs, and formula samples. So how did they know the women were pregnant? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stores harnessed the power of "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;"--predicting significant life events by tracking the women's purchases on store-issued credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; isn't just for retailers. For financial advisers, &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; holds the promise of sharper client outreach and better resource management, say industry experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traditionally, advisers have had to cozy up close to know if a customer was coming into money or getting ready to leave the firm. But that's only practical if you have a small client base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most advisers only keep close tabs on their biggest clients," says Matthew Wein of Qualified Media, a publisher of financial-adviser databases. "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big data&lt;/span&gt; gives them insights on their other clients' 'life events'--marriages, babies or divorces--they wouldn't otherwise have, unless it was long after the event." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spotting a life event before its too late is an opportunity for an adviser to take action--make a phone call, send a card or a gift basket--with a view to cementing the relationship and maybe turning a small client into a big one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethan Eden runs Market76, a company that helps independent advisers track their clients. But until recently he helped run Diastole Wealth Management, a registered investment adviser in Guilford, Conn., with around $500 million under management. Besides sales and client management, he likes &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; for its power to improve small-advisory operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Diastole, Mr. Eden culled internal data to test clients' relative profitability. "We wanted to know if the $10 million client we'd be spending a lot of time on with meetings and phone calls was as profitable as the $3 million client we hardly heard from," he says. "A principal adviser's time is one of the valuable assets a firm has, and we wanted to know if we were making the best use of it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Eden also used data from the firm's financial records to show colleagues that some kinds of business--such as 401(k)s--may boost assets under management, but take up more time and invite more regulatory scrutiny than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's one thing to make an argument, just tell a young adviser something like this," he says. "Being able to show them is more powerful." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gartner Inc. says the hunt for business-relevant information tucked away in databases and social-media sites will drive $28 billion in information-technology spending this year and $34 billion in 2013. But the consulting firm also predicts the term "&lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt;" will be obsolete by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may be a good thing. There's already a lot of confusion around the term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It really means data you can't handle with a normal mainframe," says Mr. Wein. "It's like Carl Sagan used to say: 'billions and billions'--of whatever--stars, price points." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class="hit"&gt;Big data&lt;/span&gt; is a sketchy term, but it stands for something advisory firms can't afford to ignore, says Alex Pigliucci, head of Accenture's wealth- and asset-management business. With capital markets subdued, it will be a vital point of differentiation for firms that want in on the $30 trillion or so that baby boomers will be passing to heirs in the next few decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; point here is that these heirs--Generation X and millennials--are likely to be heavy and habitual users of social media and other technology-based tools that are prime targets for &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="hit"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; mining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, large banks and brokerages are spending a lot on &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of putting smaller firms, which have been winning market share from them, back in the shade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But small firms don't have to be idle, says Mr. Wein. First, they should be aware of the concept and on watch for &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="hit"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; applications that make sense for them. Second, they can do small things like cull through clients' LinkedIn profiles for word of promotions and new jobs they can respond to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Eden agrees that even stop-gap efforts to make headway with &lt;span class="hit"&gt;big data&lt;/span&gt; can pay off. "It's like everything else, you make the most gain from your first steps," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit: By Thomas Coyle &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>Wall Street Journal (Online)</pub_title><author>Coyle, Thomas</author><abstract>[...]large banks and brokerages are spending a lot on big data in hopes of putting smaller firms, which have been winning market share from them, back in the shade.\n</abstract><title>Stay Close to Clients With 'Big Data'</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1113325353?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Oct 19, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1113325353</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
