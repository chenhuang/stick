An article last Sunday about massive open online courses, using information from theMOOCprovider Coursera, included several errors. The source of a study of peer grading in a Princeton sociologyMOOCwas Mitchell Duneier, the teacher, not Coursera. The student work was regraded by Professor Duneier and his teaching assistants, not by Princeton instructors. And it is not the case that the results have been released. The article also misspelled the surname of a co-founder of anotherMOOCprovider, Udacity.  He is Michael Sokolsky, not Sokolosky.
