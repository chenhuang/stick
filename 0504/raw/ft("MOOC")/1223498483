<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; This week, the final grades came in for a Johns Hopkins University course in biostatistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ordinarily, that wouldn't be news. This is a special case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 740 students passed the class taught by JHU associate professor Brian Caffo. They paid nothing to take the class, and they will get no formal credit, only a statement of completion. But these students, a small fraction of more than 15,000 who signed up for the seven-week online class, are pioneers in an experiment that is taking the higher education world by storm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nov. 4, The Post reported on the movement toward massive open online courses, known as MOOCs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caffo's course was one of several from JHU on the Web platform called Coursera. In all, 33 universities are partnering with Coursera to offer MOOCs. Another important &lt;span class="hit"&gt;MOOC&lt;/span&gt; platform, edX, is led by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Wednesday's paper we also reported on new effort by the American Council on Education to review selected Coursera courses for credit-worthiness. There is talk of doing the same with edX courses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great debate is arising among university leaders about the wisdom of giving away courses for free. I have found plenty of skeptics, among them George Washington University President Steven Knapp and University of Southern California President C.L. Max Nikias. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read on for the final metrics on Caffo's class and a few thoughts from the associate professor at the university's school of public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Number of students who signed up for Caffo's class: 15,930. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Number who ordinarily sign up for the class when it is taught solely on campus in Baltimore: a few dozen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Active users in the final week of the class: 2,778 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total unique visitors who watched Caffo's video lectures: 8,380 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total who submitted a quiz: 2,882 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total who submitted homework: 2,492 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total who passed the course (averaging 70 percent or better on quizzes): 748 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total who passed with distinction (averaging 90 percent or better): 447 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here is Caffo's take: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regardless of how MOOCs wind up, it is awesome to be a professor in a time where teaching is the hottest topic in higher education at research-driven universities. I also have a lot of sympathy for democratizing education and information. Very few people will have the privilege of a Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health education. But, with these efforts [including free online initiatives such as Open Courseware, iTunes U, Coursera] everyone can get at least some fraction of what we believe is fundamental knowledge for attacking the world's public health problems." &lt;/p&gt;</fulltext><pub_title>The Washington Post</pub_title><author>Nick Anderson 1 1 Nick Anderson</author><abstract>Active users in the final week of the class: 2,778 Total unique visitors who watched Caffo's video lectures: 8,380 Total who submitted a quiz: 2,882 Total who submitted homework: 2,492 Total who passed the course (averaging 70 percent or better on quizzes): 748 Total who passed with distinction (averaging 90 percent or better): 447 And here is Caffo's take: "Regardless of how MOOCs wind up, it is awesome to be a professor in a time where teaching is the hottest topic in higher education at research-driven universities.</abstract><title>Grades are in for a pioneering free Johns Hopkins online class (Posted 2012-11-14 20:39:43):Â What a Johns Hopkins professor is learning about teaching to the world</title><document_url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1223498483?accountid=14696</document_url><pub_date>Nov 14, 2012</pub_date><pq_doc_id>1223498483</pq_doc_id></DOCUMENT>
