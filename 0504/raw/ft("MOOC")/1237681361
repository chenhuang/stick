<DOCUMENT><publisher>The Washington Post Company</publisher><fulltext>&lt;p&gt; The latest must-have accouterment for your luxury Upper Northwest home: A hockey rink. This being D.C., the homeowner's move to install a 30-by-64-foot icy expanse has raised hackles on his Wesley Heights block, the Post's Annie Gowen reports. The house used to belong to Richard Nixon; now it belongs to Brooke Coburn, a Carlyle Group managing director, who is installing the rink after embarking on a major renovation of the home. "Can people do this?" asks his next-door neighbor. People indeed can do that, and after a permitting snafu, the rink is now installed and legal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other news: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mother killed, baby wounded in Metrobus shooting in Fairlawn (Post, WJLA-TV, WTOP) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil Mendelson begins to navigate D.C.
