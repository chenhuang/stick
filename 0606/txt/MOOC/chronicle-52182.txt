Foreign Policyon Monday named its“100 Top Global Thinkers 2012”list, and a face familiar to higher-education leaders sits in the top five. Sebastian Thrun,Udacity’s founderand a pioneer ofmassive open online courses,beat out Bill Gates and ranked just below Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Many observers have credited Mr. Thrun’s upstart company with spearheading a higher-education revolution, but this honor apparently has nothing to do with MOOC’s.
The magazine’s editors insteadheap praiseon Mr. Thrun for working toward a different kind of revolution—namely, a driverless-car revolution.
Foreign Policysuggests that Mr. Thrun’s work on the futuristic car might make him “the Henry Ford of a new era.” It makes no mention of Udacity or classes enrolling hundreds of thousands of students. So here’s a bit of unsolicited advice for aspiring MOOC leaders who long to be mentioned in the same breath as the Clintons: Keep your day job, but try building some eye-popping robots, too.
