Karen Head joins us today and in the coming months to report on her group’s efforts to develop and offer a MOOC (massive open online course) in freshman composition. She’s an assistant professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Literature, Media, and Communication, and director of the institute’s Communication Center. So far higher education hasn’t seen many introductory writing courses taught in such a format, so we expect there’ll be lots of interest in this experiment. Thanks for joining us, Karen.
