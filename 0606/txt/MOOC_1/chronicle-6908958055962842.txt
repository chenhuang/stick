He has16 coursesslated for the fall, a seed-grant program to encourage course development, ahandfulofplatforms,and no long-term plan. That is, no fixed long-term plan: In an interview withThe Atlantic,he tells Jordan Weissmann that flexibility will be key:
It remains to be seen what really works best. But I think we’re entering a period, and we’ve been in a period, of experimentation where we have the scientific method. You know, hypothesis: if we put video online, people will be happier. Then we’ll try that and see how it goes and we’ll try different ways of doing that. And it will vary by school.
The computer-science professor has also toldThe Chroniclethat in thinking about outcomes, he’ll be especially focused on the students who will be taking the courses:
If I could reduce the number of hours per year I spend at a large lecture and have more time that I spend at a cafe with small groups of students, that would be more fun for me, and on balance it’d probably be more fun for the students, and everybody would be happier.
