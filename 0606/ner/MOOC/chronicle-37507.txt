By now, very few people in the known universe haven’t heard what happened to the college football star Manti Te’o.
Back in December, the all-America linebacker was publicly humiliated when it was revealed that his girlfriend, whose supposed death during the season received national media attention, not only hadn’t died but had never existed.
In other words, the person with whom he thought he was communicating all those months, via cellphone and text messages and social media, wasn’t really the person with whom he was communicating. He was the victim of an elaborate hoax known as “catfishing”—which, according to <LOCATION>UrbanDictionary.com</LOCATION>, occurs when “internet predators … fabricate online identities in order to trick people into emotional/romantic relationships.”
But isn’t that the essential problem with all forms of interpersonal communication conducted solely via technology—you’re never quite certain who’s on the other end?
Unfortunately, that appears to be just as true for online education as it is for online dating. While some studies have found that, in general, cheating isn’t necessarily more prevalent in online classes than in face-to-face sections, there is one type of cheating that is more common online because it’s usually more feasible—and it may be the worst type of cheating there is: having one student impersonate another, sometimes for money.
In“Cheating in Online Courses: A Qualitative Study,”published inThe <ORGANIZATION>International Journal of Instructional Technology</ORGANIZATION> and Distance Learning,<PERSON>Manuel Vilchez</PERSON> and <PERSON>M.O. Thirunarayanan</PERSON> note that “with online classes there are more options for committing academic dishonesty while taking the class such as … coercing a friend to take the class for you or sit adjacent to you with the intention of aiding you throughout the course.” They later describe an interview with a subject who had been paid by another student to take two online courses.
The <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Association</ORGANIZATION> is concerned enough about this sort of thing that, according toH. <PERSON>Swint</PERSON> Friday,a finance professor at <ORGANIZATION>Texas Aandamp;M University at Corpus Christi</ORGANIZATION>, the organization “recently mandated regular access and interaction between teachers and online students satisfying core credit requirements.” He goes on to say, “Obvious concerns include educational quality and the ease of cheating or even false impersonation by online students absent face-to-face interaction.”
And this was all going on back when online classes were still relatively small and closed—when enrollment was regulated and limited in much the same way as face-to-face courses. That was before “massive” and “open” somehow became desirable traits in a college course. (Wasn’t decreasing class sizes all the rage just a few years ago?)
What’s going to happen when we start herding unprepared, unmotivated, and (in some cases) unwilling students into MOOCs? How are we going to monitor those courses to make sure students are who they say they are? Can we, even? Is it unreasonable to speculate that, with so many students in such a wide-open virtual environment, the types of cheating <PERSON>Vilchez</PERSON> and Thirunarayanan describe—including paid impersonation—will increase exponentially?
If you think that sounds far-fetched, or that I’m being hysterical, or that I’m insulting students by suggesting some might stoop to fraud, consider that many of those students inhabit a youth culture in which pretending to be someone’s love interest for two years is so common they have a name for it.
If they’ll catfish each other, why in the world wouldn’t they catfish us?
