   Regardless of what you think of “massive open online courses” (
   &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;
    MOOCs
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ), they are currently getting a great deal of attention in the media.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Perhaps most prominently, syndicated columnist Thomas Friedman wrote not
   &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/opinion/sunday/friedman-revolution-hits-the-universities.html"&gt;
    one
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , but
   &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/opinion/friedman-the-professors-big-stage.html"&gt;
    two
   &lt;/a&gt;
   recent columns that sing the praises of MOOCs. This morning the
   &lt;em&gt;
    New York Times
   &lt;/em&gt;
   reports that a legislation is in the works in California to “
   &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/education/california-bill-would-force-colleges-to-honor-online-classes.html?hp"&gt;
    force colleges to honor online classes
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ” for credit, including those offered by private vendors. If passed, this legislation seems likely to create a gold rush (sorry) to California by commercial educational technology companies.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   There have been a number of persuasive critiques of the rush to MOOCs (see, for instance, Mark S. Byrnes’ “
   &lt;a href="http://byrnesms.blogspot.com/2013/02/moocs-and-books.html"&gt;
    MOOCs and Books
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ” and “
   &lt;a href="http://byrnesms.blogspot.com/2013/03/moocs-and-books-ctd.html"&gt;
    MOOCs and Books, continued
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .”), but today we’re interested in hearing from ProfHacker readers who have actually been in one of these online courses.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;
    Have you participated in a MOOC as a student? Did you finish? What was your experience? Please share in this week’s open thread!
   &lt;/strong&gt;
