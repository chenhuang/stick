   &lt;/iframe&gt;
   Google has taken what its officials call an “experimental first step” into online education, releasing open-source software called
   &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/"&gt;
    Course Builder
   &lt;/a&gt;
   in hopes that universities will use it to deliver free online courses.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The search giant says it is in talks with edX—a
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/uc-berkeley-joins-edx-effort-to-offer-free-open-courses/37969"&gt;
    partnership among
   &lt;/a&gt;
   Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of California at Berkeley to
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/harvard-and-mit-put-60-million-into-new-platform-for-free-online-courses/36284"&gt;
    offer free online courses
   &lt;/a&gt;
   —though officials declined to comment further. A post on Google’s research blog this week also cited nine universities interested in using the platform, including Stanford University.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “We’ve been in touch with a number of universities, and I think it’s a confusing time or an exciting time,” said Peter Norvig, Google’s director of research, in an interview with
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Chronicle
   &lt;/em&gt;
   late Wednesday. “We’re close with Stanford—Coursera and Udacity both came out of Stanford. They’re working on their own open-source project, and they’re also interested in working with us. I think schools are experimenting and they don’t know quite yet what they want to do.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Google tested the software when it offered a free open course this summer called Power Searching, which attracted 155,000 registered students. The software is available for download, but installing it requires some technical prowess and a server to run it on. Google has also released
   &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/wiki/DesignProcess"&gt;
    suggestions for designing online courses.
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This first version of Course Builder will be updated and could become a more polished Google service in the future depending on how it is received, Mr. Norvig said. The service could become a tool for anyone to build and deliver their own courses, he added.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Mr. Norvig is not a stranger to MOOC’s—he co-taught a free online artificial-intelligence course that helped spark interest in their potential and attracted some 160,000 students. He announced the release of Course Builder in
   &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=GAY5ICoVnA8"&gt;
    a YouTube video Wednesday.
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
