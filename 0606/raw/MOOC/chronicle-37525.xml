   In a
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/onhiring/should-i-take-this-class/37093"&gt;
    recent post
   &lt;/a&gt;
   I discussed whether it’s OK to advise students not to take a class from a specific professor who is a bad teacher. Many commenters asked how I knew that someone was good or bad in a classroom—a valid question since student opinions are based on a variety of factors.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Like Isaac Sweeney, who has elected to
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/onhiring/taking-a-class-i-usually-teach/37239"&gt;
    take a MOOC section
   &lt;/a&gt;
   of a course he teaches, I have actually been a student in the class of the professor whom I keep hearing about from students. I took advantage of a tuition-grant program at my college, which allows adjuncts to take four credits free each semester they are teaching.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Professor X was not a good teacher. This is coming from me, someone who has succeeded in her educational pursuits and can pretty much do her own thing to figure stuff out. The professor didn’t know I was a colleague, so I don’t think that had any bearing on how the class was run.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   I never received any feedback. None of us did. There were worksheets—badly mimeographed exercises—to be turned in. Instruction was straight from the book. There were absolutely no projects or technology or interaction. It was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. I felt as if I was wasting my time. If I had paid for the course, I would have made more of a fuss. As it was, I muddled through, got my A, and filed away my distaste for Professor X.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Until recently, when I started hearing complaints from my students. I know of what they speak. It is still a sticky situation, as evidenced by the varying views of commenters. I’ve not come up with an overarching policy on what to tell students. I feel their pain, having been in their shoes, yet I still want to be professional. I appreciate the perspectives of you, dear readers, for moving me along in my thinking about this issue. For now, I’m taking it on a student-by-student basis.
  &lt;/p&gt;
