   &lt;/a&gt;
   I’ve discussed the potential value of
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/program-or-be-programmed/37448"&gt;
    learning some scripting
   &lt;/a&gt;
   for any major in the past, and President Obama recently called for more of a focus on making sure students know “
   &lt;a href="http://gamasutra.com/view/news/186830/Obama_Lets_give_more_kids_the_opportunity_to_make_games.php#.USa1SKXqnVE"&gt;
    how to actually produce stuff
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ” with computers, citing game design as a potential motivation. I’ve been participating in the
   &lt;a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu/"&gt;
    Learning Creative Learning MOOC
   &lt;/a&gt;
   from MIT Media Lab, and this week we’ve been working with Scratch. Scratch is certainly a powerful entry point for the type of learning Obama called for. Playing with Scratch reminded me how powerful it is for a language that uses building block code, and made me reconsider it for introducing fundamental programming to some of my non-coders in the classroom. Scratch is a powerful way to support goals like Brian’s of
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/teaching-kids-to-make-thatcamp-report/34078"&gt;
    teaching kids to make
   &lt;/a&gt;
   –but it’s for more than just kids. I grew up with
   &lt;a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html"&gt;
    Logo
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , a highly visual tool where writing simple code “commanded” a turtle to create things on-screen, and I’m amazed by how far we’ve come since then. Scratch provides a platform for anyone to try making animations, interactive experiments, and games. Unlike the tools I’ve looked at so far in this series —
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/make-games-in-the-classroom-with-inform-7/45717"&gt;
    Inform 7
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ,
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/classroom-adventure-with-inklewriter/45873"&gt;
    Inklewriter
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , and
   &lt;a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/creating-interactive-texts-with-twine/46413"&gt;
    Twine
   &lt;/a&gt;
   –Scratch is highly visual and intended to provide a clear introduction to code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Scratch has
   &lt;a href="http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Scratch_1.4_Download"&gt;
    free downloadable versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . For classes in labs where installing software is tricky, there’s also a
   &lt;a href="http://beta.scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/"&gt;
    web-based version in beta
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that worked fairly well for me. The
   &lt;a href="http://info.scratch.mit.edu/sites/infoscratch.media.mit.edu/files/file/ScratchGettingStartedv14.pdf"&gt;
    Getting Started
   &lt;/a&gt;
   guide takes you through most of the basic features, and there are tons of video tutorials for more advanced projects–I recommend starting with the ones on the
   &lt;a href="http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Video_Tutorials"&gt;
    official site
   &lt;/a&gt;
   and
   &lt;a href="http://learnscratch.org/"&gt;
    LearnScratch.org
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . There’s also a strong community through learning by sharing:
   &lt;a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/channel/featured"&gt;
    uploaded projects
   &lt;/a&gt;
   can be downloaded and their code examined for inspiration. You can check out some of the Scratch projects by participants in the Learning Creative Learning course in
   &lt;a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/192539"&gt;
    this gallery
   &lt;/a&gt;
   (
   &lt;a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/anasalter/3127899"&gt;
    mine is here
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ). Scratch also comes bundled with several sprites and backgrounds to make it easy to get started–I’ve used them below.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_46725" style="width: 557px"&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/files/2013/03/scratchplay.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Scratch" class="size-large wp-image-46725" height="397" src="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/files/2013/03/scratchplay-547x397.jpg" width="547"/&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;
    Click to embiggen.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Scratch’s promise of “
   &lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/Scratch-CACM-final.pdf"&gt;
    programming for all
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ” is fulfilled through an approach to coding that is highly sprite-based and intuitive. What I particularly like about Scratch from a programming perspective is how the tool doesn’t obscure the logic of the code. The block-based code structure is drag and drop, but most of the fundamental structures are available. For instance, commands for responding to player input can be attached to a sprite and used to create a player-controlled character: in the example below, I’ve connected the statement “when [down arrow] key pressed” to the desired outcome, “change y by [-10].” All the statements are already there for the user to drag and configure, with different options controlled by typing in a new number or selecting a key from a menu.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Looking beyond the basics, Scratch gets even cooler
   &lt;a href="http://scratch.saorog.com/"&gt;
    when connected with Microsoft Kinect
   &lt;/a&gt;
   to allow anyone to make motion games. As the platform is primarily education-focused, the
   &lt;a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/"&gt;
    ScratchED
   &lt;/a&gt;
   resources reflect both the strong history of Scratch in K-12 and after school programs and some of the uses in
   &lt;a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/search/results/taxonomy%3A116"&gt;
    higher education
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
