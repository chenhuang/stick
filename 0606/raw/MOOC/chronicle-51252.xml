  Antioch University announced on Monday that it had reached an agreement with the Silicon Valley start-up company Coursera to offer students college credit for
  &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/What-You-Need-to-Know-About/133475/"&gt;
   MOOC’s,
  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;a href="http://www.antiochla.edu/news-events/media-and-press-room/antioch-university-becomes-first-us-institution-offer-credit-mooc-l?reff=twitter"&gt;
   news release,
  &lt;/a&gt;
  the university, which has five campuses in four states, said its Los Angeles location would offer the Coursera courses “for less than the per-course cost of tuition and fees at either of the California public four-year university systems.” The Los Angeles campus created a pilot program this fall in which its students could enroll in two Coursera courses created by the University of Pennsylvania; three additional courses will be offered this winter, and the university hopes to introduce an expanded program nationwide next year.
