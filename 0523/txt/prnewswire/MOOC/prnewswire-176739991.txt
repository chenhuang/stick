WASHINGTON,Nov. 1, 2012/PRNewswire/ -- Arizona State University (ASU), Buffalo State, aState University of New Yorkcampus and theUniversity of Illinois Springfieldwill useCourseSitesTM, the free, fully hosted and supported cloud-based system for a variety of open education initiatives, Blackboard Inc. announced today.Each of the institutions examined several online course platforms before choosing CourseSites for projects which include, at some institutions, open courses and massively open online courses, or “MOOCs.”.ASU’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences will pilot CourseSites in a “global classroom” in collaboration with Leuphana University in Germany. Project leads at ASU found several features of CourseSites to be attractive, including its support for blog feeds, mobile access and Web conferencing."We looked at some of the bigger names in the space before choosing CourseSites," saidRuvi Wijesuriya, Director of Learning Technologies at ASU. "But you need to think in terms of support and functionality, and the ability of the platform to do what you need it to do. That's why we chose CourseSites.""CourseSites' integrated platform for the multiple delivery modes including discussion, blogs, wikis, synchronous discussions and more, coupled with the self-enrollment feature, takes many of the technical challenges out of delivering a MOOC, allowing us to focus on content and engagement," saidRay Schroeder, associate vice chancellor for online learning at theUniversity of Illinois Springfield. The university will launch an open course on CourseSites in January titled "Emancipation Proclamation: What Came Before, How It Worked, and What it Followed."Buffalo State, which will run a six-part open access online course called "OER 101: Locating, Creating, Licensing and Utilizing OERs" using CourseSites later this year, was impressed by the platform's ability to support self-enrollment, peer review and the adaptive release of information in courses."CourseSites' support staff have been so welcoming and really supportive," saidBeth Burns, instructional designer at Buffalo State. "In a course with hundreds of participants, tech support is instrumental in making the experience a success. And tech support for CourseSites is outstanding."To date, 45,000 instructors from over 150 countries have leveraged CourseSites to support online courses. Launched in 2011, CourseSites is a free, cloud-based course option that leverages Blackboard's latest technology for course management, Web collaboration and mobile learning, and can be accessed in English, Spanish, Dutch, French, German, and Brazilian Portuguese.For more information about Blackboard Learn, please visithttp://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Learn/Overview.aspx.About Blackboard Inc.Blackboard Inc. is a global leader in enterprise technology and innovative solutions that improve the experience of millions of students and learners around the world every day.
