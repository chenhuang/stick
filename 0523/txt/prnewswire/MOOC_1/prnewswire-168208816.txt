The foundation has been supportive of policy measures to create quality open source textbooks for college students throughout the nation. "This is the first time government has come in with substantial dollars that match philanthropic efforts to create a library where students can access free textbooks and faculty can utilize their skills to remix, revise and repurpose these textbooks for their students."Introduced by Senate President proTem Darrell Steinberg(D-Sacramento) in February, SB 1052 provides for the selection, development and administration of the free open digital textbooks for the most popular lower-division courses overseen by the establishment of the "California Open Education Resources Council" (COERC). COERC, established by the legislation, will be comprised of faculty members from theUniversity of California,California State Universityand Community Colleges to determine which courses merit inclusion.  Its companion bill, SB 1053, creates the California Open Source Digital Library to house the open source textbooks and courseware.The legislation creates a competitive "Request for Proposals" (RFP) process inviting faculty, publishers, and others to develop high quality digital open source textbooks and related courseware.  The materials would be placed under a "Creative Commons" licensing structure that would not only allow students and faculty free access, but would also allow instructors to create customized materials from the textbooks and other courseware.  To ensure the materials meet the rigorous standards of college core curricula, all material would be reviewed and approved by subject matter experts.20 Million Mindsis a non-profit organization dedicated to greatly reducing textbook costs.
