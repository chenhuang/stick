The materials will be placed under a "Creative Commons" licensing structure that allows students and faculty free access, and allows instructors to create customized materials from these textbooks and other courseware. Materials must also meet the rigorous standards of college core curricula, and will be reviewed and approved by subject matter experts."This is a great victory for students and middle class families struggling with the ever-increasing costs of higher education," said Steinberg. "This is a major step toward using technology to cut costs for students while enhancing the quality of higher education inCalifornia.""At a time when the cost of attendingCalifornia's public colleges and universities is skyrocketing, GovernorJerry Brownrecognized that by embracing our digital future with innovative technological advancements like open source textbooks we can save college students inCaliforniamillions of dollars in escalating book costs," said 20 Million Minds Foundation PresidentDean Florez.  The foundation has been supportive of policy measures to create quality open source textbooks for college students throughout the nation.  "This is the first time government has come in with substantial dollars that match philanthropic efforts to create a library where students can access free textbooks and faculty can utilize their skills to remix, revise, and repurpose these textbooks for their students."Funding for the bills also signed by the governor (SB 1028), appropriatesfive million dollarsfor the project  from the state public college savings plan ScholarShare Trust fund to be matched by private entities and philanthropy.Dr.Larry Green, Mathematics Co-Chair ofLake Tahoe Community College, who has been utilizing a free open source textbook for his students, praised the governor.

"Choosing to adopt an enhanced digital open textbook for my students spares them several thousands of dollars in combined textbook expenses and increases student success. I thank the Governor for recognizing the need to provide faculty with the tools necessary for remixing curriculum while preserving academic freedom by providing free quality textbook choices for college professors and their students."The open source library will allow students to download textbooks for free or pay around$20for a hard copy, and was the principle reason the signed bills received approval by theUniversity of California.Today Governor Brown released a YouTube video with college students as he signed the open source textbook bills.
