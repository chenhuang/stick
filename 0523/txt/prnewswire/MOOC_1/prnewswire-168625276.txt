WEU plans to launch in late fall 2012.About World Education UniversityWorld Education University represents a game-changing paradigm shift in the American and global education model by providing tuition-free education to all.  Aiming to be a comprehensive education ecosystem with programs from "Pre-K to Gray," WEU first seeks to be an accredited provider of high-quality, university degrees and credentials that are offered to anyone, anytime, anywhere.With the education system as we know it in crisis, high schools failing students in masses and post-secondary programs offering varying levels of instructional quality at extraordinarily high cost, the time is ripe for WEU. WEU brings a completely fresh perspective to the education model, building content and programs around the needs of learners and the industries that will eventually offer them jobs.We believe that free university programs and degrees will have massive worldwide appeal, breaking down traditional economic, geographic and cultural barriers for students domestically and internationally.Contacts:Sue Hanson:sue@susanhanson.comSusan McLester:susan@mclestercontent.comSOURCE  World Education University
