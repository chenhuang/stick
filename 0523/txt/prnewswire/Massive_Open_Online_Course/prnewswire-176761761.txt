Some institutions have chosen to pursue a massive open online course format (MOOC), and some have chosen to pursue a smaller online course format with more interaction. Often the courses are taught on the same platform the institution uses to teach tuition-based courses, which means students have a seamless experience as they progress through their academic journey."Canvas Network enables us and other participating institutions to decide the way we want to structure our courses," saidJoel Hartman, vice provost and chief information officer at theUniversity of Central Florida, a pioneer in online education. "We value the ability to leverage both the highly capable Canvas platform, as well as all we have learned about online teaching and learning over the past 17 years."Any institution, big or small, can use Canvas to offer open online courses.
