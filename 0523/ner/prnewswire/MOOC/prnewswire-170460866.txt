Under the legislation, these textbooks would have a "creative commons" license to allow for the free use and customization of the open material, producing cost savings and sharing among university faculty throughout the nation.Examining only 10 of the top courses inCaliforniacolleges, the 20MM infographic reveals that one student alone could save over$1,600per year on required books for the courses. At the statewide level, students' savings for the 10 courses would total over$162 millionper school year. With higher education on the rise, the bills could produce over$1 billionin savings forCaliforniastudents and college students across the nation over the next decade.20 Million Mindsis a non-profit organization dedicated to greatly reducing textbook costs.
